Entry: 
A lot of people don’t like Jordan Peterson these days. People like Vox Day and Owen Benjamin and others have said he’s sold out. Whether that’s true or not, even they acknowledge he often speaks the truth, and he speaks it here.
Anyone who believes Hitler was a Christian believes anti-Christian hate propaganda. Hate propaganda that comes predominantly from Postmodern NeoMarxist universities and from Internet Atheism Cult Forums and YouTube channels and various phony “history” sites litter the Internet, but scholarly references affirm Mussolini and Hitler were both brutal repressors of and murderers of Christians. Especially the Catholics and the Lutherans in Germany. Stop trusting Internet sources, too much of it is Fakeapedia trash and people with axes to grind. Go with legitimate historical references, like Rabbi David G. Dalin’s The Myth of Hitler’s Pope.

Title: Why Does Anybody Care About Richard Carrier’s Sex Life?
Author: Max Kolbe

Category: Escaping Atheism
Date: November 21, 2018
Entry: 
Every once in a while in our adventures in Atheistland–which is not the only topic we talk about on Red Pill Religion but it is a perennial favorite–we run into another story about pseudohistorian Richard Carrier’s supposed evil nature as a creepy sex predator. Or, about how he’s supposedly being defamed for petty jealous reasons with false allegations.
Honestly? I have NEVER been interested much one way or the other with Carrier’s sexual pecadillos, because he’s from Professional Atheistland, and in Professional Atheistland, the men and women are all either:
1) Sexless desperate nerds with no social skills. They are often highly unattractive but mostly on purpose. Note the On-Purpose part: they’re virtually all afflicted with poor self-image and self-loathing.
2) Some “sophisticated” variety of “polyamoury,” which is what in the old days we used to call “swingers.”
I’m quite certain Richard Carrier’s been very sexually promiscuous, in ways a lot of people would find gross or unhealthy. Also, he lies brazenly about history for a living, so he would obviously lie about anything else, too. Including whether or not he had “consent” to do whatever he did. Or whether he says he or didn’t do.
Liars lie, after all.
But this is Professional Atheistland, and the women in Professional Atheistland are women attracted to manipulative narcissists. Women are rare in Professional Atheistland, but they are all also either desperately unattractive and unhappy loners desperate for validation, OR, “sophisticated” swingers. They take pride in their “open-minded” sexuality and multiple partners. Liars lie, and “regret rape” and “rape allegations for revenge” are real things that women who don’t have any morals and ethics will use.
To be honest, if you’re in a room full of people who do nothing but obsess about sex and open-mindedness about it, and take pride in their many sexual adventures, “consent” become a meaningless concept.
In short, I don’t know what happened, because these people are all into wild crazy sex. They just help prove that “consent” isn’t really a coherent concept legally or morally when it comes to sex. If anyone consented to anything, it was when they walked into a room full of sex-obsessed neurotic ideologues in a bizarre hate cult.
How about we go back to a notion that promiscuous sex is neither healthy, brave, admirable, or even attractive. Indeed, isn’t good for anyone involved let alone society as a whole. How about we start respecting that “monogamy” is actually natural in humans (much much well-established science shows) and socially desirable.
And that promiscuity is neither brave nor admirable. Besides the sexual diseases and unloved or aborted children it brings, it also eventually brings about confusion and recrimination and more.
Richard Carrier lives in a land where everybody’s most important value is being “not judgemental” about sex, but being judgemental about everything else. Except that people with no morals usually turn on each other.

Title: Why Are Most of Red Pill Religion Team Anonymous? Freedom From Atheism Foundation.

Entry: 
One of our favorite outfits on the Internet is the Freedom From Atheism Foundation. We happen to know some of the principals behind it–more than 6 years ago they started and they received countless death threats, character assassination, attempts at professional smearing, and more. They have a Wall of Atheist Hate on their Facebook page, filled with examples of things we saw when we started this project three years ago. 
We’ve seen all of this and more on Red Pill Religion, which is why those of us who can stay anonymous, do. 
The good news is the tide is slowly turning. The Freedom from Atheism Foundation is probably more popular than the militant ideologues of the Freedom from Religion Foundation, for example.
Atheist groups tend to be funded by wealthy donors. Groups who oppose the hateful “Atheist” political and cult groups, like FFAF or Red Pill Religion or others, run entirely on grassroots volunteer labor and support.
By the way we could use your financial support. Find the links to our Patreon, Paypal, and Bitcoin on the right sidebar of this site.

There are a lot of people that claim to want to make Christian Fundamentalism not seen as extreme. Yet seem to hold extreme views such as Apostolic Succession isn’t important, or that strictly Scripture with the exclusion of tradition (both Oral and Written) should be the only source of doctrine and dogma. Tonight we will examine patristic ideas and writings which are the fundamentals of Christianity. Sources used: https://www.amazon.com/Cambridge-Comp…

Chapter 1 – Old in Age but Young in Mind
Most people wish they could live forever the way they did when they were children. Zita was spoiled as a child even as an adult. When she did bad in school, her parents took her out of it permanently and taught her how to live by themselves. They gave her everything she wanted and more. Her parents were her only friends for most of her life until they died when she was thirty-five years old. She inherited their great wealth and did whatever she wanted.
Inspired by the internet, she played video games, reviewed anime and manga, and generally acted like your average attention whore on the web. To get even more attention, she intentionally put naked pictures of herself across the internet. In addition, she played and reviewed hentai video games, and recorded doing lewd things and put all of this on pornographic websites. All of this gave her the attention she wanted. She felt loved and important. She thought that as long as she did whatever her audience wanted, she would be happy forever.
Zita is forty-years-old now, but still dresses and looks like she’s in her early twenties. With her dressing style and makeup, she hides her age. Even though she’s a bit chubby because she never leaves her apartment, her fans like her because she’s “thicc” and that’s enough for her not to worry about her health. She even uses to entice people to make them think she likes wearing tight clothes even though it’s a bit uncomfortable. Her apartment is mostly a mess hidden by the few clean spots in it that she shows on camera. The rooms with her collections of comics, video games, anime, and movies are all spotless along with the room that she sleeps in that contain her figures. The apartment room smells like a weird mixture of candy and perfume to coat the stink of an unclean room.
Today is a strange day for her. Her front door is locked along with the windows. She can’t break them down nor can she call or text anyone. Her computer mysteriously won’t turn on as well even though she had it upgraded not too long ago.
“I need to think what to do over breakfast,” she says as she looks into the fridge only to find that it’s empty. “I could’ve sworn I bought food, drinks, and ingredients last week.”
Zita’s parents taught her how to breakfast, lunch, and dinner for herself, but she usually orders. Now with nothing to eat, she lays down on her couch, hungry, worried, and confused as to what is happening. This is when a large hand forms out of her wall. It opens its hand to reveal a mouth in the center of its palm.
The hand says to her, “Zita, I am the hand of judgment. You have yet to grow up and take responsibility for your actions.”
“I’m a good girl who doesn’t do anything wrong. What are you talking about?”
“You will see very soon. There’s a hole in your closet. Climb through it and you will escape your room to face your first challenge.”
“Challenge? Do I get a prize at the end?”
“If you win, you will grow up and live a better life. If you lose, you will suffer for all eternity.”
“And if I don’t accept the challenge?”
“You lose automatically, and you’ll have to rot to death in this apartment.”
“I’ll take the first option then.”
When she goes into her room, the hand of judgment follows her by forming out of the ceiling in her room.
“Are you going to be my guide?” Zita asks the hand.
“In a way, but I your choices will determine whether or not you will survive.”
“That’s peachy.”
Zita moves her clothes around and finds a large hole in it.
“You didn’t make the hole this large because you think I’m fat, do you?”
“It’s made with the intention of you going through it. Now go if you have decided to.”
Even though the hole is relatively large, Zita has some trouble going through it. It’s a tight fit that’s difficult to go through. She reaches the end of the tunnel after ten seconds of crawling. The tunnel has led her to a small aquarium with various kinds of fishes in the many tanks. Paintings of the many fishes are drawn swimming through the ocean on the walls. Above her is a curved glass ceiling that shows the night sky even though it was morning when Zita left her apartment.
“Okay, where to now?”
“You must reach the exit of this building while being hunted by a hunter who is modeled after yourself,” the hand tells her. It’s nowhere to be seen but its voice echoes through her mind.
“What’s this challenge supposed to prove?”
“That you’re honest about changing for the better.”
“This’ll be easy then. I’ve played so many hide-and-seek horror games already.”
Using her knowledge of horror games, Zita carefully walks through the aquarium while trying not to make any noise. The entire building is uncomfortably quiet so much so that she can hear the fish swimming in their glass casing. One of the fishes catches her attention. It’s a red Chinese fighting fish that is swimming by the end of the tank looking at her. Back in her youth, Zita wanted to study fish and take care of them, but when her patience for the subject wore out, she left it behind like so many other jobs that interested her. When she gets close to the fish, it hits the glass so hard that the noise reverberates through the building and leaves a crack in the glass. Another crack of glass is heard above Zita, as she looks up to see her monster. It drops from the ceiling and crashes into the floor unscathed.
The monster is huge as it takes up half the hallway. Its skinny pink clothes are so tight that its skin oozes a black liquid. The arms of the creature are thin, and its fingers are as long as Zita’s arms. Its legs are swollen from its thighighs along with its feet. Black veins pop out from the creature’s skin as well as its bony spine. Its hair is a dirty blond with a thin black bow on it. Pink makeup covers its broken face that has no eyes.
“If this is like those psychological games I played, then I can handle this!” Zita confidently says as she punches the hunchbacked monster in the face to no effect.
It grabs Zita and slams her into the ground multiple times then smashes her into a fish tank and drowns her. She wakes up in her bed and begins to vomit water. The water never stops coming out of her stomach, so she goes to the bathroom and almost fills up the tube with all of the water she vomits. This is the first time in a while that’s she felt any kind of real pain, any kind of defeat. Her appearance is now that of a woman in her late twenties with most of her makeup gone. The damage done to her was immense and is multiplied by the fact that she’s lived a comfortable life for all of it. Her nerves are shot, and her body convulses with panic.
In need of immediate relaxation, she takes out one of her sex toys and tries to use it, but a sharp black spike comes out of it and impales her from her crotch through to her head. Instead of dying immediately, it takes her body a few agonizing minutes of the worst pain to kill her. Again, she wakes up in her bed, but this time she feels completely dead inside. She can’t make herself feel better instantly. She’s died twice already without completing any of her challenges, and now she looks like she’s in her thirties with no makeup at all. Despair has its grips on her, freezing her in thought.
The hand of judgment says, “You will need to grow up if you want to survive this. Get up and try again. If you don’t, then you’ll suffer forever because of your previous actions. Decide.”
The black and whiteness of her choices force her to move out of her bed and back into the aquarium. Zita doesn’t let anything distract her this time. Her monster still jumps down from the ceiling, but this time she runs and hides. The monster cannot smell her, and its vision is very limited, so it focuses more on sound than anything else. It overcomes some of its disabilities by smashing whatever hiding spots that Zita could hide under. Because of this, she is forced to go from hiding spot to hiding spot until she realizes that she’s close to the exit. When she sees it, she makes a break for it and makes it through the exit right before it catches her.
Upon exiting the aquarium, Zita finds herself back in her apartment standing in front of her front door as if she just went through it. She tries opening the door and finds that it’s still locked from the inside. After the challenge, she falls to the floor in tears.
“I don’t know if I can do this,” Zita admits to herself.
“Of course you can. You just made it through the first challenge. That shows me that you have a chance of getting through the rest,” the hand of judgment says with a stern but caring voice. “Now get up. Another challenge awaits you and the main vice that damages you and the people you affect.”
“Oh boy. What fun,” Zita miserably says.
 
 
 
 

Chapter 2 – Hunter and the Hunter
“Where did you make the next exit?” Zita asks with a dry voice.
“Just go through that door,” the hand says as it points towards it.
Zita smiles a bit as she remembers what’s behind the door. A spark in her mind wakes her conscience up and makes her think that what she loves to do might be wrong.
“You know what’s behind that door,” the hand says, “Your vices will destroy you if you don’t let go of that destructive force within yourself.”
“I…I don’t know if I can…but I have to try, right?”
“You have to not only try but accomplish it. There must be no hesitation in your decision or else you will die.”
Zita has never had so much pressure on her. Her body still doesn’t feel the same after the two painful deaths she suffered. She can feel a change happening in her mind and body.
“What you’re feeling is change. It feels painful, but it is good for you,” the hand notes as it notices her pain.
“I hope so. If I have to go through these challenges, then I will.”
Zita opens the door and ends up in a park with the sun setting. The gates around the park are locked and the edges of the fences are sharp and could cut anything that touches it.
“You remember this park, don’t you?” the echoing voice of the hand asks.
“I do. It was a fun place to be in.”
“But you never used the park as most people use it.”
“I did. I met people here. Tons of boys that wanted to be my friend.”
“You did more than become friends with them. Even though the sun is setting, it will soon rise up again. Stay alive until then.”
Zita quickly looks for a hiding spot and places in the dark to stay.
“What? No quip about your video games?”
“Huh? Oh uh…I don’t have one right now.”
After looking around, Zita finds a spot to hide in. It’s a small hollow out hump that people like to climb and sit on. It’s covered by trees and there is a little scattering of boulders and rocks nearby that are left there from the park’s construction. The deafening silence sets in as Zita hides within the lump and waits. An hour seemingly passes before a murder of crows is disturbed. They fly into the sky and away from whatever spooked them. Looking deeper into the darkness, she sees her monster creeping through it. It moves quietly despite its large size though it doesn’t appear to know where Zita is, for now.
Even though she isn’t in any immediate danger, Zita’s heart starts beating fast and her monster appears to pick up on it. Seeing that it’s reacting to her heart, she calms down by thinking in jokes. She reminds herself of the small good times she had playing games, which had her in similar situations to this, but not as deadly of course. Her efforts rewarded her with dozens of “friends” because of her simple ability to play video games and react to them in front of a camera.
She then began to think to herself, “That is a pretty shallow thing to do that most people try on the internet nowadays to become famous and rich. I’m not as special as I think I am for doing the same thing they are. Maybe there’s something more I can do with the talents I have. Maybe I can get new ones that’ll do more for people.”
After thinking for a bit, Zita notices that it’s getting brighter outside. The thought then hits her that she survived the last challenge by not messing around and dedicating herself to changing, so she continues thinking.
“My parents were very smart people and saved up money until they could live on it without having to work for the rest of their lives. They even saved up enough for me to live on their inheritance for the rest of my life as well. I can do things with the money I have and not worry too much about failing once or twice. They were really good parents, but…do I really want to give up this life? Everything that I love in it. Everything that makes me happy. Everything that gives me…pleasure…”
A small shriek is made from the darkness. A horde of five childlike creatures emerge from the trees. They have blank faces and parts of their flesh missing like a jigsaw puzzle. Something about these creatures stirs a part of Zita. She starts to feel hot and she starts to rub her arms. This feeling gets so extreme until she feels like she wants to touch herself more sexually. Zita resists until she lets the feeling overwhelm her. This is when her monster and the creatures know where she is.
Unfortunately, Zita is trapped within her lust and has to fight for control over herself. It isn’t until the monsters are right on top of her until she’s able to run away. She regrets giving herself up to her temptations as she runs through scattered rocks. Her monster crashes through what’s ever in its way while the children leap all around her, trying to find an opening to attack her from. Eventually, she runs out of cover and a child manages to cut off her right leg with one swipe. Time begins to move slowly as the rest of her limbs are cut off by the creatures.
“What did I do to deserve this? Am I really as good as parents always said I was?”
The creatures then tear out her eyes then her jaw along with all of her teeth. Her breasts are torn out as well with her ears and nose while the rest of her body is cut at until she is nothing more than a bloody mess that looks more like a pig than human. Despite her injuries, she’s still clinging to life and the sun is still trying to rise, so there’s still a chance that she might win.
“I regret what I did. I see why it’s wrong now. I’ll give it up not because I want the pain to end, but because it’s the right thing to do.”
The sun then begins to rapidly rise as her monster stands over her. It picks her up and tears her body in two just as the sun takes its place in the sky. Zita wakes back up in her room.
The hand says, “Because of what you said, you passed your challenge just barely. Congratulations.”
Zita gets on her knees and bows before the hand.
“I’m sorry for everything I’ve done! Even though I don’t think I can bring myself to get rid of my vices, please give me the strength to do so.”
“That will be done. Because you have shown humility, you will no longer be killed as long as you continue showing it. Now go into that room and release him.”
“Okay.”
Zita enters the bedroom next to hers to release the young boy she has captive. The boy is a fan of hers who she managed to meet up with. She usually tries to meet her young fans that are boys to have sex with them. This boy, in particular, told his parents that he would be away for a while with his friends. Zita’s been using him as her personal sex doll for almost a week now. There were some boys that stayed for entire summers tied up and under Zita’s control because they were captured by her degenerate influence.
She unchains the boy and gives him back his clothes and what he came with.
“What is it, Zita? You seem stressed. Are we going to go out together?”
“No, you’re going to have to go.”
“Why? Am I boring you? Maybe there’s something I can do to change your mind.”
The boy tries touching Zita inappropriately, but she smacks his hand away.
“No! I’m sorry I did this to you. It was wrong of me to do this to you and so many other young boys.”
“But I liked it and I thought you did too.”
“I did, but that’s changed, and you should too. You shouldn’t let people take advantage of you like this. You’re a smart boy who should be doing more with his life than just looking for sex.”
“Oh…well. Um…”
“Go home to your parents and live a better life.”
“Okay. Will I ever see you again?”
“You shouldn’t, but if you do, I’m not going to be the same.”
“Alright…well. Goodbye then.”
The young boy hugs Zita, takes his stuff, then leaves the apartment. Zita walks up to the door and tries opening it but finds that it is locked again as it only let out the boy.
The hand says to her, “Do you really believe the reason why you are wrong?”
“Not really. Every boy I was with consented to me.”
“Not every boy consented to you. You aren’t even allowed to have sex until you are wedded. There’s a man about your age a couple rooms down that you make small talk to. He’s interested in you, but you’ve barely given him any attention. Are you so sick that only boys thirty years younger than you are the only kind that interest you?”
Zita looks into a mirror to see that she almost looks her exact age.
“But I made them feel happier, didn’t I? I’ve had so many boys tell me how happy they were when they were with me. I’ve made so many friends because of it.”
“You still have a lot of change to go through.”
Zita sighs then says, “Then change me. I’m ready.”
 
 
 

Chapter 3 – Deadly Ignorance
The hand of judgment says, “If you are to truly change, then must accept what you are not. You must die in a manner of speaking.”
“I’m used to dying.”
“Physically yes, but not in terms of your personality. That part must die.”
“How do I do that?”
“Admit where you are wrong. This next challenge will help you do that.”
“Okay. Where’s the next uncomfortable hole I need to crawl through?”
“You don’t need to go anywhere.”
“Sweet.”
“You won’t think it’s so “sweet” when the challenge starts.”
“What do you mean?”
Zita is immobilized and falls onto her floor.
“Ow. I guess my floors are a bit too dirty. I do have to clean myself up a bit.”
“That’s only part of it, which I’m glad you’re seeing.”
“Is it because I’m lazy? Do I watch too much anime and play too many video games?”
“You can keep your comics and video games. Just get rid your pornographic materials including the things you have on the web. You’re allowed to have your leisurely activities as long as you keep it in moderation.”
“Alright. I can do that. Is there anything else I should know?”
“If you’re able to think about it, then you can be released from this challenge before it starts.”
“Umm…Ahhh…I got nothing.”
“Then your next challenge starts now. Everything that happens to you is in your mind. Nothing you see is true. Nothing you feel is real. Keep that in mind and you will survive.”
“What I’m imagining for this challenge, isn’t too good.”
“You have the right idea.”
“Wait-Nevermind…I’ll go through it.”
“Good.”
The hand retracts itself into the wall as Zita awaits what she knows it coming. She can hear something moving within the walls of her apartment. It sounds like the childlike creatures are coming for her. They sound like they’re splitting up into different groups to find an opening in the wall to enter through. Their claws scratch at the inside of the walls and break little bits and pieces out of it, but they are unable to break through the walls or find an entrance in.
A few minutes of nerve-wracking seconds pass by with nothing happening. The creatures don’t make any noise, nor can they be seen through the holes they made. Zita then begins to feel something strange stirring within her. A pain that feels unnatural that’s coming from places that these pains shouldn’t be coming from. She calms herself down and reminds herself that nothing she is feeling is real. This calms down her pain, but it doesn’t get rid of the sensation.
Four child creatures then emerge from her body. Her ears, mouth, and stomach to be specific. These places of her body expand beyond what their limits are and yet they don’t break. Zita feels the pain of these creatures clawing their way out of her and her mind is tempted to think this is real despite the absurdity of it. The pain is intense and numbs her senses and reason. She starts to sweat blood from the stress of the situation as her body begins to think that this pain is real.
Zita wrangles control of herself and thinks, “I…I can’t think this is real! It-it just isn’t!”
Her pain subsides again though the sensations still remain. The four creatures are now outside of her body that is back to the way it was before as if the creatures never emerged from it. They stand over her and start to caress her body like a massage therapist looking for tension and stress in a person. The creatures then begin to cut bits and pieces of her skin out. Each piece of skin cut out is more painful than the last, but she stays strong.
Seeing that she’s won’t even scream, the creatures then begin to cut parts of her body like they did in their first appearance. First, her arms go. Then her legs. Then her eyes. Zita closes her eyes after they’ve been plucked out and is afraid to open them up as the creatures slowly run their claws all around her body.
“I…I don’t know if I can do this anymore!” she thinks to herself as the pain worsens.
“Remember, Zita. Are you going to put yourself first? Or what is truly right?” the hand says.
“I’ll…I don’t always know what’s right, so…I put my trust in what is actually right.”
“Then open your eyes.”
Zita opens her eyes to see that she can see. The creatures have disappeared along with her injuries. She can now stand up perfectly fine as if nothing happened at all. Her room now seems to be clean and whatever blemishes she had on her body are gone as well.
The hand then reappears out of the wall, “Your faith has healed you.”
“Oh, that’s what that was. I understand now.”
“But do you? Can you tell me what you did wrong?”
“I’m afraid I’m a bit slow. I can’t word it correctly.”
“Instead of wanting to learn what is truly good, you stuck yourself in the willful ignorance of your parents.”
“My parents weren’t good people? They helped so many people in their careers and made me happy for the rest of their lives.”
“Fool. They were self-righteous hypocrites who only helped those who helped them, and you perfectly took after them. If you weren’t so ignorant to the truth, then you would’ve been struck down by now by your own hand.”
“I’m still struggling to understand where I went wrong.”
“Keep in mind the lesson you learned. That what is truly good is better than what you have in mind. Don’t play God with your decisions by thinking you have equal or better solutions than God has.”
“I wouldn’t do that.”
“But you have along with most people who say the same thing. They’re nothing but children who live in their own fantasies where they dictate what’s right and wrong, even if they say it’s from God. Do you want proof? You will see the fruits of the tree you’ve planted in your final challenge.”
“Will it be more painful than the last?”
“It will, but in a different way than you’re thinking.”
 
 
 
 

Chapter 4 – The Death and Rebirth of Self
“Where’s this final challenge of mine?” Zita asks the hand of judgment.
“You already know where it is. It is in the only room you didn’t go in yet.”
“What about that room?”
“Don’t be so ignorant. You know what’s special about it that separates it from the other room you freed that captive boy from.”
“It’s my recording room.”
“The last time you used it you recorded a pornographic video in it, and I’m sure the boy you recorded it with has yet to come out.”
“He…I guess consent doesn’t matter.”
“It’s not the consent that matters the most in this situation. It’s what you did to the poor boy. Go and free him.”
“Alright.”
“You knew you were going to have to do this. Clean up your mess now before your soul decays further.”
Zita enters her recording room and frees the boy she has strapped to a small bed. He has a gag around his mouth, a cloth around his eyes, and his arms and legs are tightly constricted to parts of the bed. With the removal of each strap, Zita remembers what happens to a particular boy. She saw him one day after traveling away from another boy she had just “entertained”. This boy looked special to her. A kind that she had never tasted. Wanting another boy to satisfy her rising desires, she took the boy aside with promises of large sums of money. The two were alone where no one would bother them then tried to entice the boy to have sex with her.
He respectfully denied her, something that she had not known. No boy had ever rejected her, no one told her she couldn’t have what she wanted. Zita tried everything she could to seduce him to submit to her, but he never did. She then forced herself onto him and had her way with him. He tried fighting back with a self-defense knife. Even though the knife could’ve easily killed Zita, she was too much for him as she made him drop his knife. After having her way with him for over an hour, she finally let him go and cleaned herself up.
“Wasn’t that fun?” she asked the boy while she was still in ecstasy.
The boy, after being defiled for so long, had been mentally damaged beyond repair. He grabbed his knife and cut his own throat. Zita tried to save him but there was nothing she could do. There was no way for her to deliver the boy’s body to his parents without the consequence of her being arrested after, so she buried his body and possessions, and left the area. There were many other boys like this one, but no other had killed themselves after because she got them all to submit themselves to her.
This boy that Zita has in her recording room is one of her fans. He only knew of her normal content since her more degenerate content was a secret among her fanbase. The only people that know about it are her diehard fans that lust after her. This boy was offered to stay with Zita for a long period of time, so he could learn from her what he could do to become moderately internet famous like her, and he learned more than he wanted to. He’s been trapped here for two days now and has somewhat submitted to Zita’s lusts.
The hand says, “How many boys have you turned into degenerates? They do nothing but look at pornography, have premarital sex, and rape like you do. Their souls are so severely damaged that it will take years to properly fix them. Now you know why your treatment has been so severe.”
The weight of Zita’s sins finally has their effect on her body as she kneels before the hand. “I’m sorry for everything I’ve done! Please, God, forgive me!”
“Bring this boy back to his parents then talk to the man two doors down from you. You’re blessed in that the boy doesn’t live too far from here.”
“Wait, I can’t be forgiven if I talk to God directly?”
“You can’t. You don’t have that privilege. Your soul will be damned forever if you don’t confess and do penance.”
“I thought I was saved forever after being baptized and accepting God as my savior.”
“Another lie that your parents taught you. That lie has damned so many souls to Hell and created so many hypocrites.”
The boy is unconscious and isn’t able to wake up.
“The boy won’t remember what you did to him after you do what I told you. If you don’t do what I tell you, then all of your sins will be exposed to the world and you will be executed then sent to burn forever.”
“I’ll do it! I’ll carry him home, just show me where he lives.”
The hand puts Zita’s head in its mouth which shows her exactly where the boy lives. She dresses him in his clothes, picks him up, and runs out the door. It’s currently nighttime and raining now. Zita doesn’t have a car so she has to run in the rain. She avoids attention from other people and uses the darkness and rain as cover as she did before when she took in random boys. Her lusts tempt her to go back to her apartment and forget about what the hand told her. She rejects them, which frustrates the demons within herself causing her to feel pain.
Her lusts manifest themselves into creatures with vaginal faces, male sex organs, enticing bodies, and sharp claws. They form themselves from the darkness and chase after her. Their speed allows them to quickly catch up to Zita so they can claw at her back. They tempt her to let go of the boy and give him to them, but she resists again. This constant cycle of temptations and pain continues until she reaches the boy’s house. She lays him at the front door, knocks and rings the doorbell. After hearing someone coming, she runs away as her lusts continue to swipe at her until they cut off her head.
Zita wakes up in her bed to a new morning. She rubs her face a couple times to make sure it’s there. After that, she looks into the mirror to see that she still retains the younger than her actual age look, but something about her looks different, brighter. Inside her closet, she finds clothes more proper to wear. She puts on a simple shirt and skirt then goes online to find that all of her pornographic content has been scrubbed from the internet much to her relief. She then exits her apartment to find the man the hand told her about. He smiles as she timidly approaches him.
“Hello, Zita,” he says, “How are you doing this fine morning?”
“I’m doing good. How are you?”
“I’m great now that you’re talking to me. I’m a big fan of your show online. I can’t entertain an audience like you can.”
“It’s nothing. I’m sorry for never paying much attention to you.”
“Don’t be. I’m sure you’re a busy woman.”
“It’s not that. Ummm. I’d like to get to know you better-if that’s okay with you.”
“Oh, that’s fine with me. I’m actually going to confession now. Do you want to come? We’ll have breakfast together then we can go out wherever you want.”
“I’ll come with you, but we can do whatever you want.”
“Sure. There are these great places in town that I know you’ll love.”
“Take me there then. It’s going to be your treat though.”
“I wouldn’t be a man if I didn’t treat a lady like you.”

“Love, to be real, must cost. It must hurt. It must empty us of self.” – Blessed Mother Teresa
Chapter 1 – Forced Love
How are we ever going to fix this?
Maybe we should start from the beginning?
Maybe you should since you suggested it.
Okay. We woke up one morning in my room fused together. We were confused for a while before we heard a voice say, “Because you have hated each other and have secretly wanted harm upon one another, you will be fused together until you learn to love each other”. And here we are.
That’s overly simple, James. What about the fact that part of my house is fused to yours? My clothes are even fused to yours. Just look at our wardrobe. Everything is fused together.
Don’t worry about it, Julia. At least it all matches.
But we’ll have to go to the bathroom and take a shower together! We’ll see each other naked!
That’s definitely the worst part.
Ow!
Ha! When you use our hand to hit me you still hurt yourself.
Ow!
Doing it again doesn’t help and I know that you feel that it does. I’m still somewhat surprised that the doctors said that our bodies are completely fine together like this.
Sure, but we have to walk together with a hood on all the time with our heads down.
Speaking about that, do you want me to control our legs when we walk because we have trouble doing anything unless we consent to let one person walk?
I don’t care. We both get tired even when we let the other do something.
I’ll do the walking then.
I’ll do the talking.
You’ll do the talking? No.
Why not?
Because you’re terrible at talking with people.
No, I’m not!
Yes, you are. Who has more friends than you do? Who got a promotion because I was a pseudo-human resources expert? That’s right. I know the thought crossed your mind.
Shut up. What am I going to do then? Just silently scream in our mind?
Oh God no. I’ll let you talk if you know more about something than I do.
But we both know the same things now.
Are you really going to pass up this opportunity to talk?
You can stop me from talking at any time.
And so can you so you’re going to have to trust me. Okay? Come on. We can’t do anything unless we can trust each other.
Fine.
Good. So how about we get ready for work now? We didn’t take a shower yesterday, so let’s-okay. You know for a fact that I don’t want to see you naked. Okay! Now you have a self-abuse problem. So, do you want to strip us or-
I’ll do it. Just close your eye.
I can still see out of your eye.
I’ll just look up then. Hey, make the water hotter.
It is hot.
No, make it hotter like this.
It’s too hot!
I don’t feel it.
I do!
Good.
Who’s going to be the one who’s going to wash us?
I’ll do it.
I didn’t know you wanted to touch me like that.
It’s not that! I’d rather you not touch me is all.
It’s still our body.
Whatever.
What kind of genitalia do we have?
It’s not mine and it’s not yours. I don’t want to think about it. Just stop thinking about it.
Okay. That’s finally done. I think we should wear this simple outfit.
Nope, we’re wearing this.
Who cares what we look like?
I do! I’m a woman of business unlike you.
Do women of business look like us? That’s what I thought. What’s for breakfast?
Cereal.
I’m fine with that. Except not that kind.
What’s wrong with it?
It’s just plain healthy cereal.
What are you four years old? Why does your cereal have to have marshmallows in it?
Because it actually tastes appetizing.
It doesn’t taste bad to me.
It does to me.
It’s just your imagination.
Whatever. Okay, you bathed, clothed, and feed us which is basically what a normal woman is supposed to do. Don’t hit me-us. Let me take over for walking.
I still don’t feel comfortable going out at all.
But we got to earn that bread for ourselves. It’s not too bad.
I feel so awkward being out here like this. This is going to be a pain if this carries over into the summertime.
Ever hear of short-sleeved hoodies?
I still don’t want this to go on for long.
And I thought you were starting to like my company. We have to do this regardless of how comfortable we are with it, so we have to start loving each other.
I’m not going to marry you.
You don’t have to. Love isn’t all about marrying.
I hope that’s not what God wants.
Me too. See? We’re starting to agree with one another.
But what are we going to do now at work?
Whatever we usually do. I think we should-
No, we can’t talk to anyone like this. Only our boss knows about this.
He would’ve already told most of the people here by now knowing him.
What an idiot. We already have people looking at us.
Don’t mind them.
“Hey, James! Or should I say, Julia? Or both?”
“Hey, Nick!”
Are you still mad at that the boss is paying me more than you?
I went to college and work harder than you do. Of course I’m still mad.
I didn’t need that stupid college “education” to be successful in life. All I needed was my family, friends, and my God-given talents. Don’t be mad because I got past where you are with more effort.
I’m going to beat you to a pulp when we’re separated.
You would still be hating me then.
I’m going to lovingly beat you to a pulp. Sound better?
Yep. This is where we decide which of our jobs are going to get done.
Okay.
Ow!
What did we do?
We fell on our butt because we took control of a different leg to go in a different direction. Let’s just decide what we’re going to do first.
I’ve got tons of work to do to help dozens of people within the business and outside of it. At least I try to help others outside my sphere of friends, unlike some people.
Well, you can’t do that if your building burns to ashes. Most things in the building are working fine but I have been seeing abnormalities in it. I should probably check it out before it gets serious.
What? I’m not going to get dirty while wearing this.
You knew we were going to. Don’t lie.
Can’t we just get my work done first?
Let me just check out the systems in the building. Maybe we won’t need to get dirty today.
I always see you dirty.
Yeah? Well you’re always jealous of me, and I’m not making that up, so let’s go.
Fine.
Okay, well everything seems to be better than yesterday. It looks like shutting off some of the systems fixed some of the issues, but there’s still one thing we have to get dirty for to check out.
What? Why?
Because it could cause a major fire if we don’t at least check on it. I adjust and upgrade these things from time to time so that you can “help” people like you say you do.
Let’s just get this over with.
It’s not that bad up there.
To you maybe. It’s filthy up here.
I’m glad you think so.
Why don’t you clean up here? Isn’t that a hazard or something?
Not if it doesn’t affect anything. I’ve been in worse places, so this is nothing to me.
I can’t stand being in here.
Just keep your mind off it then. There are only a couple more things I need to check.
Was that a roach?!
Yeah, I named him Bob.
Why don’t we call an exterminator?
Because buildings like these always have bugs in them. They come and go and if they feel comfortable, they stay.
But shouldn’t we get rid of them?
This is your first time noticing them, so they’re not a problem to you. They’ll be gone soon.
That’s a relief.
Okay. It looks like there isn’t anything wrong here.
So we came up here for nothing?
We came up here to check on something that could’ve been important. I’ve been doing this for months and you haven’t had any problems, which is another reason for my promotion.
Okay, let’s just get out of here. I think I’m going to get sick.
That’s just your imagination.
No, it isn’t. I feel like I need to take two baths after doing that, but I have to get my work done.
This is going to be so boring.
It’s not that bad. It’s just how work is.
My work isn’t like that.
Your work is disgusting and dirty.
But at least it doesn’t put me to sleep. This sucks so much.
Shut up. I’m trying to concentrate here.
Did you notice that the others aren’t saying anything?
The boss told us that he told them not to say anything or he’ll fire them.
It’s probably why we’re not on the news right now.
Do you ever shut up?
No, that’s why so many people like me. I’m also trying to keep us awake.
I don’t need your help.
Fine then. Nap time then.
Wait…stop…Ah!
Told you this work is boring.
Just try to stay awake a little longer. I’m almost done.
How come you never liked talking to me when we first met?
Because I wanted to concentrate on my work.
And that’s why you don’t have friends. How can you say you want to help people when you don’t even want to talk to them?
How can you say you love making friends when you don’t care about helping other people?
Hey, at least I do help people. At least I don’t just think I’m helping people because people tell me I am when I’m just sitting behind a desk while being miserable. Hey! Control yourself! People are really watching now. I’m sorry, okay? I can be a bit too blunt. I get that. You help out people in your own way and I do it in my own way.
…
Look, that paper you made is probably going to convince the company to help out people in need. Do you know how many lives you’re going to save?
Stop wiping away my tears! I can do it myself!
Okay.
…I’m sorry for that outburst.
It’s fine. I get it.
“Hey, uh…Julia? The boss wants to see you.”
“Okay.”
This is my fault.
I started it. Don’t worry about it.
He might fire us.
I don’t think he’ll do that. He probably just wants to talk to us.
“Hello, James and Julia.”
“Hello, Lloyd.”
“Who am I talking to specifically?”
You’re better at talking.
“James.”
“I can hear it now. Did you know that your voice changes when one of you is in control?”
“I didn’t notice that actually. Thanks for pointing that out. What did you want to talk about?”
“I’m letting you two or one have a little break from work to get used to being together like this.”
“Was it something-”
“No, it wasn’t anything you did. Besides, I know you don’t get aggravated, James.”
I messed up bad.
“It’s not Julia’s fault she got angry. I said some things to her that I shouldn’t have.”
No, you’re right. Don’t even think about using this against me.
“It’s not that she lost control. I just want you two to get better acquainted with the way you are now. You’ll be paid during your time off as well so don’t worry about that.”
“Thank you so much.”
“Don’t worry about it. Just try to get adjusted soon so I can have my two best workers back.”
“You got it.”
See? That wasn’t so bad.
That’s because you were talking.
I didn’t say anything that you wouldn’t’ve.
I wouldn’t have defended you.
That’s true but I’m glad you’re honest.
Let’s just go home. I’m beat.
That wasn’t such a bad day of work. I thought it was pretty interesting.
It was okay.
At least we learned to be caring towards one another.
I wonder how long that will last.
Come on, be more positive.
Sure.
More positive!
Very sure. I’ll take that. So, what do you do after work?
Shower, eat, then sleep. At least it isn’t as awkward taking a shower now.
Uh, you’re making me look-there we go.
Sorry. It’s a habit.
It’s fine. I don’t mind too much. Don’t hit me.
I wasn’t thinking about it for some reason.
See? We’re getting comfortable with each other now.
A little too comfortable.
What do we have here to eat? Uh, oh! I still have leftover pizza here. I’ve been craving it.
I’ll make us something. Hey, stop making me crave pizza!
It’s pepperoni and sausage.
That does sound really good. Wait, no it doesn’t. Stop making me want it. I don’t even like eating pizza.
You what?! You’re going to Hell.
For what?
Not liking pizza. It is one of the many foods God inspired humanity to make. Let me fill your mind with thoughts and sensations of the blessed food.
You already take up too much of my mind, but it does sound appetizing. Okay, I’ll try it.
So? How does it taste?
I’m not sure if you’re making me taste it this way or not.
I’m not doing anything.
Then it tastes great even though it’s just heated up again.
See? I told you.
Okay. Fine. You were right. Now it’s time to get some sleep.
Today wasn’t so bad, right? I don’t mind being with you like this as much now.
I can’t say the same.
I know you’re lying.
Don’t think I actually like you now.
Well, at least we’re off to a good start.
I guess so.
I’m glad that you agree. Good night.
Good night.
 
 
 
“The Bible tells us to love our neighbors, and also to love our enemies; probably because they are generally the same people.” – G.K. Chesterton
Chapter 2 – Learning to Love
Time to wake up, Julia. Huh? Why did you think of your ex-boyfriend? He seemed like a nice guy.
He wasn’t. Do you see that orange fox on my side of the bed? He got me that one Valentine’s day. Not because we were in a relationship, but because we’ve been friends since we were kids. We were each other’s only friend for years. The only other kind of love we felt was from our parents. We or at least I thought we were going to be friends forever. I thought we were going to graduate from college then get married, but then…
He cheated both on you and in college.
I never heard from him since. I keep this fox by my side to remind myself not to get my hopes up, even when it comes to people I love.
That’s cold but I understand. I have my own stuffed animal too. Do you see the white rabbit on my side of the bed? That was one of the only things my parents gave me to show me that they truly loved me. They worked in services that helped people, so they were always busy and never home. I keep this bunny to remind myself that them and people, in general, can be compassionate. I seem to have a more positive reminder of people than you do.
I see that. Even though your parents weren’t always there for you, it seems like you turned out exactly how they wanted you to. But me…
I’m sure your parents are proud of you and that ex of yours has been regretting his actions ever since. Please don’t put yourself down. You’re not a bad person. You just need the right person in your life.
Maybe you are that person.
Maybe.
You sure do have a lot of big textbooks over there. Read anything interesting?
You know.
I want to hear what you think of them.
They’re interesting to read. It helps me learn more about people and their motivations. Some of them are business and math books, which I know you find boring.
It’s kind of interesting from what you remember. I recognize some of the ways of thinking from my comic books and manga.
Those are children’s books.
And there we go.
What?
We were getting along so well and then you had to say that.
What makes them adult besides violence and sex?
The themes of good versus evil, moral responsibility, man playing god, pushing people to their limits, and the extremes someone would go to for their love.
That sounds interesting. Can you give me an example?
There’s this one series that’s about this crybaby who gets the powers of a devil. He becomes totally different after that, but things don’t go well as demonkind starts to wipe out humanity.
Okay. I’m remembering it through your mind and it seems good. It’s really dark.
How about something lighter? These comics are about a man who has an alien attached to him. The two go on adventures as they protect the innocent and punish the wicked. He’s a kind of lethal protector.
Looks fun, but it seems like a different take on the previous series that you told me about.
Okay, so how about this. This series is about this black swordsman that’s after this guy who was once one of his closest friends and well…it’s a long story, but you know what I’m trying to summarize.
You like a lot of dark stories.
But I do like my light ones too. Like this one series about this girl whose hair looks like a four-leaf clover. I especially like the part where she meets this guy with white hair that she absolutely hates.
Ha! That is so cute.
Alright, now enough about that. Do you want to get up?
What do you want to do?
We could go to the nearby church I usually attend. We could ask God for answers since He put us in this situation.
Do we have to now? I’m comfortable like this.
I didn’t know that you liked being with me in bed.
Okay. We’re going.
Haha. That did it.
I’m surprised that this church is doing so well in such a filthy area.
God works where the sinners are at and there are a lot over here. It’s a good thing it’s doing so well here. No one bothers it at all compared to the other places around here.
Have you ever been jumped in this area?
Once maybe twice when I was a teenager, but we should be fine.
And if we do get into trouble?
What? Do you want to make a bet? You already have my body and everything I have. Do you want my soul as well?
I’m just asking. Wow. This place is nice. The stained-glass windows, the statues of Jesus, Mary, the saints, and angels. The atmosphere here could stop any sinner in his tracks. This looks way better than the church I go to.
You don’t attend a heretical church, do you?
No, here’s what it looks like.
Oh, it’s not bad. It just has a simpler look to it. Let’s go up to the altar and pray while no one is around. Well no one besides God.
Okay…well? Is anything coming to mind? I can’t hear your thoughts for some reason.
I’m concentrating on prayer. I didn’t hear your prayers either. Is it me or are some of our thoughts audible to us while others are silent?
It seems that way, but we do hear the important parts.
That’s right. Hey, do you bring your family to church too?
No, I just go by myself.
I bring my family and friends to church. When there’s someone who isn’t strong in their faith or worships the wrong one, I bring them here to try to convert them.
What are you an evangelist?
No, not at all. I’ve only converted a few of the people I know.
That’s great. I’m sure God is happy…with…you…
What is it?
I save people money and help them get the help they need. You help save souls. Which one do you think is more important?
You do help more people than I do.
What does it matter when I don’t help them with what really matters? I don’t even think that I put God first like how I’m supposed to.
If you think that’s bad, I don’t even try to care about people. I only try to help those I’m comfortable with. I can see why that’s so bad now.
At least that isn’t as bad as divorcing people from numbers and generalizations. I always thought of people in terms of ideologies and I never took into account their unique personalities and situations. Everyone was just a different version of an archetype that I read in a psychology book in my mind.
Oh come on. Just look at the bigger picture. Because you help so many people with their problems, they can now focus on God and the afterlife.
But most people don’t do that. How about you look at the bigger picture. You’ve put all your friends and family on the narrow path of salvation that few people find and you’re putting me on it too.
If I did, then stop putting yourself down.
How about you stop putting down the importance of what you do?
Are we really arguing for each other on who is the better person?
We are, and you know I’m right.
And you know that I’m right as well.
Fine.
Fine.
…I guess those prayers helped after all.
And in so little time. He usually takes a while to answer them.
I guess we should put an extra donation.
We’ll go half and half.
I’ll donate forty dollars. You can buy me dinner later.
That’s not fair! I know you’re going to make it pricey.
Deal with it.
At least that was good for us. What do you think?
I think we’re being followed.
I think it’s your stereotyping of people that’s getting to you.
No, it isn’t.
I’ll look-oh we might have some trouble.
Told you. You deal with them.
“Hey, man. I remember you when we were kids.”
“Oh yeah? Do you remember what happened last time you snuck up behind us?”
“Yeah, and I remember, but you’re alone now.”
“And? I don’t need anyone else to beat-oh you brought along two of your boyfriends. How great.”
I’m going to need your help with this.
What am I supposed to do? I can’t fight.
Then what was all of that big talk about kicking my butt?
I’m still going to do that.
Watch out! Punch! Left! Kick! Duck!
Ow! I can’t do all of this at once!
Neither can I but maybe we can if we join our minds into one…Ready?
Ready.
Punch! Kick! Elbow! Pull! Punch! Left! Right! Left! Duck! Uppercut! Kick! Punch!
We did it!
“Ya’ll better fix yourselves up. If I see you again, it better be in that church praying for forgiveness.”
“What are you?!”
“That’s none of your business now get out of here!”
Look at them run. See, what did I tell you?
That calls for a little celebration. What do you think?
Are you just saying that because I’m buying?
Well, you don’t have to.
I will. It wouldn’t be manly of me if I didn’t.
Oh brother.
How about we try this sandwich place in town?
What do they serve?
Sandwiches.
I know-
I know what you meant. They have all kinds of sandwiches that are hard to find outside of the city.
At least it’s in a better area.
There are so many people here.
Remember to keep your head down. We don’t want to start a fuss.
Alright.
Let me try to remember what I got last time that was good. Uh…buffalo chicken, egg salad, grilled shark, some kind of double sandwich, uh…get an Italian sausage with gravy.
Okay. Oh man. The food smells great.
“Italian sausage?”
“That’s for me!”
“Here-oh!”
Dang it, you idiot. I told you to keep your head down. He almost dropped our sandwich.
I’m too used to bringing my head up to talk to people.
“Thank you!”
People are looking at us now. Keep your head down and we’ll eat somewhere else.
Where do you have in mind?
The only place that I know that is relatively empty is the garden park a couple blocks away from here.
Why is it relatively empty?
It’s a garden park. It smells like flowers and vegetables.
I love that smell.
Then I’m going to need you to make it seem good to me because the smell is irritating to me some days.
This place looks amazing. There’s a garden house fields to play and dozens of flowers. It’s amazing that this place exists in the city.
How about we sit over there on that bench near those roses?
Sure. Now it’s time to chow down. Yum! This is so good! What are you doing with my hand?
Hold on.
Why did you pick this flower?
Because I looked at it and I thought of you. Plus, you said you liked the smell of flowers and from what I can pull from your memories, you like these kinds of flowers.
I love it. Thank you.
You’re welcome. Remember to keep your head down. We don’t want anyone seeing our face…well maybe just yours in particular. I’m kidding of course!
I know. That guy was scared to see me.
I thought he was scared to see a pretty girl’s face attached to my ugly mug.
You’re not ugly. I know from your memories that there’s a girl in that shop that always likes looking at you.
That doesn’t mean anything. I’m only interested in girls that I talk to.
You’re always talking to me.
Well, that’s because I’m forced to-but that doesn’t mean I don’t like you! I think you’re a great person.
Do you really think that?
You know if I’m lying.
Then why are we still together like this?
I don’t know. Maybe there will be a challenge ahead of us that will test us.
I hope not. I’m not sure if I can handle challenges that make me distrust people.
Hey, you know me. You know my thoughts now. Even if I do something bad, I’ll make it up.
Okay. I trust you.
Now can we please go home? We’ve had to go to the bathroom since this morning.
I hate doing that like this.
Why? We’ve showered and dressed together.
But this is disgusting like this.
I’ll be quiet.
But I know you’ll be feeling it.
I know we’ll be crapping ourselves soon if you don’t move it! Pick your poison.
Okay, fine!
See? That wasn’t so bad.
I guess not.
So we’re cool with not holding it in for so long?
You’ll probably have to convince me again.
Dang it.
Should we go out for dinner? How can we hide our face in public for long periods of time?
We did it at work, but most people knew about it. Do you want to make dinner?
Is this another woman joke?
Half and half. I want to see what you can make.
I’m in the mood for breakfast. How about I make blueberry pancakes?
Sounds great.
Let me see if we have what we need and…we do. Should I start making it?
Yes. I’m thinking about going out again.
Where to?
That garden park again. Did you see those lights in the trees and greenery? Those light up every night.
I’d love to go!
Great. Let’s speed up making these pancakes then.
You can’t just speed up cooking. You know I’ve noticed that my way of talking is different from how I usually talk.
How so?
I’ve been talking more in laymen speak than the more proper, educated way that I usually talk in.
Maybe it’s because your mind and ours are almost completely connected?
Or maybe talking to you is making me dumb. I mean you know the way I feel now. I would never have dreamed of feeling this way towards another person just a few days ago.
You’re having a similar effect on me too. I’ve changed just as much as you have.
But you know me. You’ve done more for me than I have for you.
That’s true and I’m saying anything about doing more, it’s about the change. You know I wonder why you always you want to contradict me on things like this. First, we argued about each other and now we’re arguing for the other person. I’m trying to find a reason inside your head. Is it because-
It’s because I don’t trust myself anymore. The things I’ve learned these past couple days has completely destroyed the world I once knew. Now…I don’t know what to think.
You know what to think. Stop lying to yourself. You know what you did wrong, so now you know what to do. Even if you do the wrong thing again, you can just apologize and start over.
I don’t know.
Trust me about this. You got me to like you even after we hated each other for so many months. That has to count for something. I know you don’t like yourself anymore, but you have to love yourself a little. If you don’t, then I will.
Okay…thanks.
You’re welcome. Now pay attention to those pancakes because they might be getting a bit too burnt.
They are! I’m sorry.
Don’t worry about it. I like my food well done.
Stop lying.
No, it’s good. Great even! I’ve never tasted pancakes this good.
It tastes too burnt.
Yeah they are.
I’m glad you’re being honest with me now.
I was being honest!
Sure. Should we go out now?
Yeah. The lights should be on by the time we get there.
Okay. Wait, I just pulled up a memory that says you’ve never seen the lights?
Not at all. I’ve been waiting for someone to go there with.
Someone special?
You could say that. You ready to see them?
I can already see them from here. It’s like a completely different place.
It’s better than I imagined. Look at how the lights change and how they complement the colors of the flowers.
I know you want to compare me to them.
I do.
Say it then.
Why? You already hear it in my thoughts.
I want to hear it from you.
It’s cornier than corn!
Say it!
Okay. You’re more beautiful than all of the flowers and lights in the garden. Happy now?
Very. Aren’t you?
I guess so.
Guess?
I am happy even though I’m living like this with you. I wouldn’t mind living the rest of my life like this.
I wouldn’t mind either. Do you…just want to enjoy this moment in silence for a couple more minutes before we go home?
Yeah, I’d like that.
I knew you would. That’s how I got the idea.
Ha!
 
 
 
“But from the beginning of creation, ‘God made them male and female.’ ‘For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh.’ So they are no longer two but one flesh.” Mark 10: 6-8
Chapter 3 – Together as One
Julia.
James? What is it? Is it time to get up already?
Yeah. Hey, don’t try to go back to sleep! Why do you always have to put my side of our body on the bottom?
Because that’s where you belong.
Well, I’m burnt.
That’s right. Now, go back to sleep.
We can’t. We’re so close to being back to normal. I can feel it.
Do you want to leave me this badly?
What?
You’re the only person I’ve met who I can trust completely. I know what you think and what you’re going to do. There aren’t any consequences for staying like this until we die. This is perfect for us.
Stop thinking this nonsense! We can’t keep living like this.
We’ll find a way to make it work.
I’m-hey! Let me get up!
No. You’re mine until we die.
We can live well together separated.
But it won’t be like this.
You trust me, right?
Of course.
Then you know that I will never do you wrong.
Sure, but-
You don’t have to know everything I’m thinking to trust me.
But I want to.
Then you don’t trust me.
I do trust you!
Is it just because you can hear my thoughts? It sounds like it. Trust is vital in all relationships, so if you truly love me, then let me go.
But…I might lose you.
You know for a fact that fear bothers me too. I will do everything in my power to stay with you until the end.
But I won’t have you like this.
You will if you marry me.
I…I do.
I didn’t kneel or anything, but okay. This is great. Now all you have to do is let me have my control. Hey, I’m thinking of a song my parents used to sing to me during rainy days. Are you thinking about it too?
I am. Sing it with me then.
I can’t sing.
You’re not singing out loud and I love listening to your voice.
…okay.
 
I can see it in your eyes
In your tears
All of the suffering you’ve been through
All of the pain you’ve felt
 
I can feel your sadness
Your anger and your regrets
This world is a non-stop place for sorrow
Like an everlasting storm
 
I’ll be here for you
To hold you when things get tough
When hope seems far away!
I’ll always hold your hand
Through the happy moments and the sad
When everyone else has left, I’ll be right here!
 
The clouds cry with you
Angels shed tears as you suffer
So don’t believe you are broken beyond repair
And know that you will never be alone
 
I’ll stay with you through it all
Heal the bleeding in your heart
Walk with you through the storms
Nothing will stop me from getting you to smile
 
I’ll be here for you
To hold you when things get tough
When hope seems far away!
I’ll always hold your hand
Through the happy moments and the sad
When everyone else has left, I’ll be right here!
 
When the light seems so far away,
Hold onto me!
When all seems lost,
I will always stand with you!
 
I’ll be here for you
To hold you when things get tough
When hope seems far away!
I’ll always hold your hand
Through the happy moments and the sad
When everyone else has left, I’ll be right here!
 
Right here, always with you forever…
 
You know what the song means. You know how I feel. Trust me.
…Let me think about it for a second.
Eh…fine. Just don’t take waste time.
…Okay, I think I’ve made up my mind. Did you hear what I decided? Hey, are you awake? You have to be because I am. Ow. I guess you aren’t. That’s strange. I do like staying like this. I could stay lay down with you forever…but…I know I can’t. I’m sorry that I fooled myself into thinking we could stay like this forever. It’s just my mistrust of people, but I know that you won’t disappoint me. I trust you…
“Hey, stop hitting me…”
“I didn’t hit you because I didn’t feel it…”
“Wait! Ow!”
“That’s what you get for touching me where you’re not supposed to.”
“We’re going to be married! What’s so wrong with-Nevermind, our bodies are apart! My house is back to normal too!”
“Huh?! You’re right-”
“Ow! What now?”
“I wanted to be the one to kiss you first.”
“That’s too bad. Ow!”
“Ow! You can’t hit me!”
“I can defend myself. Is it really going to be like this?”
“It will be, and you can’t stop me. Hahaha! Hey!”
“You don’t have my strength anymore. You’re back to having the strength of a nerd. Haha! Ow! Why did you hit me there? I guess you don’t want kids.”
“I can still get you. Hahaha!”
We got married soon after then began to raise a family. We still argue with each other now and then, but who doesn’t with their closest friends and family? We thank God every day of our lives for the blessing he gave us that we thought was a curse. Even though we know life will have its difficulties when we will feel weak, we will stay faithful to one another until the very end.
 
The End
 
“What is the mark of love for your neighbor? Not to seek what is for your own benefit, but what is for the benefit of the one loved, both in body and in soul.”

Part 1 – The First Death
There’s an unknown group of people that wander the country and kidnap and kill people for their own amusement. This night, they’ve kidnapped a man named Sebastian, his friends, and family, which includes his wife and two children. They force Sebastian to kill himself with a knife in order to save the life of his family. He tries to kill himself, but he passes out due to blood loss. The kidnappers don’t let him die honorably. They patch Sebastian up then kill everyone he knows. They then carve one of the Chinese symbols for failure on his head after they shave it. The kidnappers also carve three tear marks under both his eyes because of how much despair and sorrow Sebastian was in. After that, they bury him alive and naked, but since he almost did what they asked, they put him in a broken coffin with tools so that he can break out.
“We’ll let you off easy,” one of them says, “You have everything in your coffin to dig yourself out. If you’re ballsy enough, you can find out how to find us there.”
A glimmer of light in Sebastian’s lifeless eyes lights up. The kidnapper talking to him notices it but doesn’t pay it any attention.
“I will find you,” Sebastian swears, “But I won’t kill you. I’ll do worse! You better run fast and run far because I won’t have mercy on you!”
Sebastian is laughed at as he’s buried alive. He screams out his resolve as the final bit of dirt covers his grave. The kidnappers put down St. Peter’s cross before they drive off as Sebastian breaks free. He’s not an escape artist and his wounds still hurt so it takes some doing for him to escape. He emerges from the dirt as rain pours down on him and lightning lights up the night sky. It turns out that the kidnappers buried Sebastian in a graveyard not too far from his house.
He walks from the graveyard to his house while completely naked though he is unable to feel shame. His pain and anger are enough to push him forward.
“I’ll find them,” he says aloud to himself in a sneering voice, “I’ll make them all pay.”
A few people in cars pass Sebastian by and don’t bother with him. People on the streets that see him turn their heads away. No one cares about him. No one cares to think about the help he might need. Some think his situation is the result of a prank or one too many drinks. Sebastian keeps heading home while paying the same attention to them. Thoughts of revenge and what he’ll do to every single one of them course through his mind and memories of his loved ones. His anger gives way to sadness when he thinks of the people he lost.
“I’m sorry,” he says with tears flowing from his face yet again. The pain from his wounds makes it look like he’s crying bloody tears. “I’m sorry I couldn’t kill myself for you. I’m sorry they couldn’t let me die. I’m sorry you had to die for me…please…Please give me the strength to do this for you.”
Once he gets home, the first thing he notices is that the family car and his friends’ cars are gone along with the decoration his family put outside the house and the window. There’s nothing inside the house except for a piece of paper and a pair of basic clothes constituting of jeans, black sneakers, and black jacket on the floor. It’s as if his family never moved into the house. The letter has a number of places written on it with no context. These places aren’t too far from here, but the places are abandoned. They are the perfect places for Sebastian to get his revenge. The water still works in the house, so Sebastian takes a shower before changing clothes and heading out.
The first place he goes to is a small shack at the edge of town. Sebastian has to walk all the way there, but he doesn’t mind. This is the only thing in his life that he’s focused on.
“I will give my life to this if I have to,” he says to himself as if he’s telling God Himself what he’s about to do.
There’s a four-door truck outside the shack. Three people patrol the area and appear to have concealed weapons. The only person he doesn’t see is one of the people that forced him to kill himself.
“These might just be his underlings,” Sebastian says to himself while planning a strategy.
After having a plan of attack, he executes it. He takes a medium sized but heavy rock and throws it at one of the guards with it when he’s taking a leak. Once he’s down, Sebastian knocks him out with a punch to the face. The guard has a gun on him along with a wallet. Sebastian resists the idea to kill the guards and the leaders and leaves the wallet alone. The other two are sitting inside the shack and talking to each other. Sebastian knocks on the door.
“The door’s unlocked ya idiot,” one of them says.
Sebastian knocks again.
“What? Do you need help or something?”
Again, another knock.
“You’ve got to be kidding. Hold on.”
Once the guard comes outside, Sebastian knocks them out and puts their body aside. He then heads inside and throws the heavy rock at the other guard’s face and knocks him out with his fists. Sebastian finds a metal baseball bat in the shack and takes it with him. He goes outside to the backyard of the shack to find one of the people that forced him to kill his family. The man is with another victim. He’s showing the innocent man a pile of maggot infested corpses in a ditch.
The man asks, “Do you know who these people are?”
“N-no,” the innocent man answers.
“These are the people we were paid to kill mixed in with the people that chose to mess with us and people that we killed for fun.”
Sebastian begins to sneak up on them.
“If you don’t want to end up like them, then I suggest you never talk to anyone about what you found.”
Sebastian hits the kidnapper over the head, which scares the innocent who almost falls into the mass grave of bodies.
“You’re safe now,” Sebastian says to the man as he catches him from falling.
“What are you going to do?”
“I’m going to get my revenge on these bastards. I’m not going to kill them. I’m going to do worse.”
“Are you crazy? Do you even know what these people are capable of? They’re not just normal crazy people.”
“I don’t care. This is going to happen.”
“I’ll pray that you succeed but I’m not sure you will.”
The innocent man runs away from the shack. Sebastian then enacts his revenge on his first victim. He buries the man underneath all the maggot infested bodies but gives him just enough room to breathe. The man wakes up just as Sebastian is about to leave. He screams out in fear and disgust as the maggots cover him and crawl all over his face and body. With a smirk on his face, Sebastian leaves the backyard. He then takes the man’s phone and calls the police to come to this location before he heads out in the kidnapper’s truck to the next location.
“One down. Five to go. They’re all going to pay. Every last one of them. In the worst way possible,” Sebastian says with conviction.
 
 

Part 2 – The Long Night
The rain continues to pour on Sebastian’s darkest night. Lightning lights up the sky and thunder roars like war drums pounding to warn his victims of his arrival.
“I’m going to get them. I’m going to make them pay,” Sebastian says to himself over and over again, “I can do this. I have to…but what if I can’t? This’ll all be for nothing then. Would my parents approve of my actions? Would my wife still love me? Would my children still look at me as their father?”
Sebastian’s mind trails off before a bright flash of lightning snaps him out of it. He’s at where he needs to be.
“There’s no going back,” he continues, “There’s no other reason to live. If I won’t do this, no one will.”
Right now, he’s at an old grindhouse. The electricity is barely working and the blades in the building have grown dull and rusty. A couple of cars are parked at the side of the building. Peaking inside, Sebastian can see four guards and the woman that cut the throats of his children. The people here appear to be repurposing this place as a hideout. His blood boils, but he calms himself down and plans his attack. A sound from behind catches his attention and Sebastian quickly knocks out the guard with his baseball bat though he is still found out. He hastily knocks out another two guards before the rest shoot at him. He takes cover behind a piece of machinery. The guards and the woman who killed his children point their guns where he’s taking cover and slowly walk around the side to get a shot at Sebastian.
“What do I do? What do I do?” he asks himself.
The guns the knocked guards had are close by on the floor. Sebastian has never used a gun before but now he has no choice to. He runs to grab them and slides behind another big piece of machinery and manages not to get hit. Knowing he only has one shot at this, Sebastian calmly breathes in and out before running out of cover and unloading both of his guns. Ten shots land and hit the guards and the woman in the leg. He then goes up to where they are and knocks out the guards before grabbing the woman and holding her over a meat grinder.
“You actually did have the balls to come back. Ha, not many people do,” the woman says.
“You better stop killing innocent people! Or else you’ll face another person like me. Except they’ll probably kill you.”
“What? You aren’t going to do it yourself? It’s a shame that a child’s own father won’t take revenge for them. Do you remember the way they died? I do. They kept calling out for you as they bleed from their throats. I don’t know what’s so special about killing adults when children are so much more delectable.”
Something snaps in Sebastian and he strangles the woman’s neck. As she suffocates, she begins to smile as if she wanted him to do this. Seeing this, he quickly turns on the meat grinder and throws her in it. The blades are rusty and dull, and the factory is about to run out of power, so this’ll hurt, but it won’t kill her. Again, Sebastian uses one of the guards’ phones to call the police so that they can arrest these people. Sebastian then drives away still furious about what the woman said. His hands grip the steering wheel as if they were still around the woman’s neck.
“That bitch. That fucking bitch!” he says aloud before attempting to collect himself before he gets to the next place, “I gotta remember. I’m not like them. I’m not going to kill any of them. They’re just going to wish I did. But I still hurt them. I even buried one alive. Am I even still a good person? Was I ever?”
Before he can think of the answer, he’s at the next location. It’s an abandoned one-story building like the last place, but this one appears to be going through some construction. Sebastian doesn’t remember hearing about this building being built on the news, who would usually talk about new buildings. It appears that this group of murderers have enough money to create their own buildings in a not so secret way. Regardless, Sebastian parks a little far away from the building. There are quite a few trucks and cars here, so Sebastian makes sure to scout out the area before heading in. The power is on in the building, so he sneaks around and short circuits it. He then heads in through a basement window. Inside, he finds a cache of weapons, clothes, money, and various other things. These seem to be things that the kidnappers bought themselves or took from their victims, which is most likely out of the two.
Heading upstairs, Sebastian sees that there are some guards still patrolling the halls. He knocks out the nearest one near the door and hides their body in the basement. This noise attracts another two guards who Sebastian lures into the basement to take them out. Once he hides the unconscious bodies, Sebastian quickly, but quietly checks all the rooms to find his primary target. He knocks out who he can including one person on the toilet. That man’s face he leaves in the urinal.
Eventually, he finds his way to a room with a furnace. The man tweaking it is the man that killed his wife. Holding his anger in, for now, he quietly walks up the man pulls him out and breaks both of the man’s legs with his bat.
He holds up the man near the furnace’s fire and says, “Who’s the asshole who can’t do anything for his wife now?!”
“Look, I didn’t know you were with Tommy and Jefferson okay? If ya’ll just wanted us gone, then we would’ve disappeared into the wind and stopped hurting people! Or at least I would!”
“Who are you talking about?”
“What? You’re not…”
Gunshots are heard outside.
“The damn feds are turning against us after everything we did for them! They couldn’t keep their do-gooders out of the loop. Listen to me man, they’re going to think you’re a psycho like us. I can get you out of here and help you get your revenge for your family!”
“What is the furnace used for?”
“Why does it matter?!”
Sebastian headbutts the man in the face, which causes the man to lose a couple teeth.
“W-we used it to get information out of people and to scare them! We put them in those fireproof body bags over there, so they’d feel like they’re burning alive while in it.”
Sebastian looks at the fireproof body bags.
“Don’t get any ideas man! I already confessed my sins to you!”
“You confessed. Now you have to do penance.”
Sebastian knocks the man down then shoves him into the fireproof body bags. He then puts the furnace on and puts the man in it. As he watches the man burn and hears him scream, Sebastian smiles deviously, but in the fires, he sees his fate, which is similar. His smile fades away as he sees this. Since the gunfight is still going on, Sebastian sneaks through the fighting to get to his truck and drives away.
Two backup police come out of hiding as he escapes.
“Pull the vehicle over now!” one of the officers says over the car’s speakers.
Sebastian thinks about it then says to himself, “I can’t. I don’t know how long or if these killers are going to stay in their places. There’s only three left. I have to get this done myself. It’s what I have to do!”
The police cars chase Sebastian onto a highway. He weaves through cars in order to get through the dense traffic and escape, but the police stay on his tail. There doesn’t seem to be a way to escape until he sees the way laid before him.
“Well, at least this parking spot is close to where I need to be,” Sebastian says before driving his truck into a lake.
Once the truck is under water, Sebastian uses his bat to break the car window. He swims to a sewer entrance while under the cover of water. The action-packed ordeal takes a lot out of Sebastian, so he sits on the floor once he’s inside the sewer system. He breathes in the sewer stained air disinterested about how it smells and does the sign of the cross to show how thankful he is to still be breathing. This next person is supposed to be in these sewer systems for some reason. When Sebastian finds his way to a part where parts of the sewer converge, he’s ambushed by the woman who killed his family and her armed guards.
She says, “We were expecting someone else, but this’ll do. You have only one option if you want to live. Join our ranks. It might take some getting used to, but it’ll be worth it. Trust me. I was in your exact position a couple years ago.”
“It’s over for you and your band of mercenaries or psychos or whatever you are. Three of your leaders are already under arrest and the law is after you.”
“That’s not an answer I’ve heard before, but it’s also the answer I didn’t want to hear. It’s a shame too. I would’ve gladly been a replacement for your wife.”
The sewer system begins to flood because of the heavy storm outside. Sebastian and the kidnappers run away from the impending rush of sewage water while some of the guards are instantly caught up in it. The water blocks off certain passages and manages to catch the guards while Sebastian and the woman are still able to keep running. The only escape they find is a ladder that leads to a sewer grate. Sebastian is ahead, so he’s the first one to climb up. Both of them manage to climb up the ladder just in time as the flood of sewage water passes by. Sebastian looks down at the woman and she can already tell what he’s thinking.
She smiles then says, “Marry me?”
Sebastian responds by saying, “That’s not how it works,” before kicking her face and making her fall into the putrid water. “Shit is supposed to go down the toilet. Just like you.”
He gets back to land and goes back to where the sewage water gets out to see the guards and woman wash up on the other side into the arms of the police. Somewhat thankful these people are still alive. He turns around to continue his journey of revenge. The paper that says the location of the kidnappers is wet and barely readable, but Sebastian can infer what it says since he looked at it several times already. He has to walk in the rain again to get to the next place, but Sebastian doesn’t mind. There are only a couple of people left. Two more people that deserve a fate worse than death.
 
 

Part 3 – The Redemption
This next person is not too far away from Sebastian. They’re at a popular bar and town and the place is full of people tonight. Sebastian casually walks into the bar and looks around to see what he’s up against. Everyone here is enjoying a new type of drug, so they’re not a problem. In the upper room of the bar, he finds the man who killed his friends. He’s not drugged up and drunk like his friends and customers. The man is also enjoying him with two women. He has a shotgun by his side, so going in to attack him head-on might not be a good idea. Sebastian heads to the back alley to find the truck that the man and his guards came in. The truck looks like it was recently open. In it, he finds the ingredients for the drug, a gas mask, a list of what the drugs do, which notes amounts needed for a high, and a bag full of them.
He gets an idea and takes what he needs. With the drug ingredients in hand, he puts the right amount of it in the air ducts so that it spreads throughout the building. Sebastian puts the gas mask on and waits a few seconds for the drugs to take their effect. When he goes to the bar, he finds everyone giggling and smiling on the ground. They’re exhausted because of the drug and don’t have the strength or care to move. The same thing goes with the man upstairs and his girls. Now that he doesn’t have the strength to fight back Sebastian takes the man and brings him downstairs to the bar. He takes the strongest drinks from behind the bar and forces the man the drink until he pukes. He then throws the man aside and into someone’s crotch.
There’s only one more place to go now. One more person to get revenge on. Before Sebastian leaves, he takes the man’s car keys to the truck, calls the police to this bar, and drives off to the final location. The rain is still pouring hard on this particularly dark night. The lightning is striking more frequently and erratically now as if nature is playing a song to signal the end of Sebastian quest for vengeance. This next place is an abandoned hospital. When Sebastian gets to it, a couple other cars and trucks leave the hospital while a couple stays behind. Before he goes into the building, Sebastian says a quick prayer before entering the building. He starts by going through the basement. In it, his eyes see the fire again for a second before his eyes adjust to see gas canisters and a lighter among the stolen goods. Sebastian takes the gas canister and pours it into the room.
Once the gas can is empty, he goes upstairs and starts dealing with the guards. These guards are more attentive about watching the windows than the hallways so they’re not much to deal with. After they’re all knocked out, Sebastian finds his last target. It’s the man who came up with the idea that he should martyr himself for his family. The man is on the phone with someone.
He says, “Just because the others are caught, it doesn’t mean that I can’t bring us back from the brink. I did start this whole group after all…I got a few ideas, start a worldwide scare, kill a couple big names, whatever sounds too edgy to be real…Of course, I was kidding-Of course I’m being serious! Look…Ok, fine. I’ll talk to you later when something actually happens. Wait, you know what? I’ll find you and you might not like it when I do. Good day to you sir.”
The man hangs up the phone and looks over the table of guns and checks them. Since he’s caught up in thought, he’s easy to knock out, but this can’t be the end of it all. It’s too easy. This man is the leader of the nameless band of mercenaries who are also kidnappers. It is not likely that this person will change his ways, which is where Sebastian’s plan comes into effect. He takes the unconscious bodies of the guards outside of the building along with the stolen goods. After that, he uses the gas canisters and soaks every inch of the building in it. He breathes in and out slowly before going through the final part of his plan. He puts the leader of the mercenaries in a room with him and wakes him up before setting the building ablaze.
Everything quickly catches fire including the way out of the room.
“What did you do?!” the leader says in a panic.
“I lit everything on fire. It all ends here.”
“What?! Why?! I-I’ll change! I swear I will. We can both get out of this mess together if we-”
“No, I already know how people like you work. This is the only way you’ll change.”
“And what are you going to do? Huh? Did you stay just to watch me burn?”
Sebastian hugs the man.
“What are you doing?!”
“I’m going to die here with you. I’ve already forgiven you and your friends. I don’t hate you.”
“How can you not? We killed everyone you hold dear and took all your stuff. Don’t you hate me?”
“I said I forgive you. I’m willing to die with you to show you that. To show that you still have a person in this world that cares about you.”
“I…I don’t know what to say.”
“Let go of your hate and honestly confess the things you did wrong. And…please forgive me for ending things this way. The fires will only burn me for a short while, but they will burn you for an eternity if you don’t do this.”
The man begins to sob and hug Sebastian as the flames begin to consume them. Sebastian feels the intense flames for only a short amount of time. In the fire, he sees everyone he holds dear waiting for him in the eternal light with open arms.

Title: The Invisible Hi-Vis Airport Men

Category: Men's rights

Entry: 
Last winter, I had an IT contract in London which required me to get a daily train into town at 5.30am. The coaches were filled with men in high-vis jackets reading the Sun or the Mail and drinking hot coffee from Thermos flasks. There were very few women on those early morning trains.
Many of the men got off at Gatwick Airport, to prepare the terminals for the day’s flights.
These are the invisible men without whom the modern world would crumble.
These men are celebrated in the Book of Ecclesiasticus (Chapter 38):
They are not remarkable for their culture or judgement, nor are they found frequenting the philosophers. They sustain the structure of the world, and their prayer is concerned with their trade.
Please take some time to go to the link above and reflect on the words of the passage.
They sustain the structure of the world, and their prayer is concerned with their trade.
It is remarkable that the people on that early morning train through Gatwick were mostly men. It is significant that among the least philosophical, least intellectually active men, there is an instinct to develop the skills for this work. Few women seem to possess that instinct. This is raw, essential Masculinity.
Feminism does not have much effect among such men: their wives appreciate the hard work they do, and are not too proud to fill their men’s sandwich boxes and Thermos flasks with good nourishment.
These are the men who voted for Brexit and Trump, against the wishes of the elite classes who see them as irrelevant, while making use of the airports that these men wake up so early to prepare.

Title: How to Become a Man: Creating Order From Chaos

God was in the beginning, creating the Heavens and the Earth.
The Earth was without form and void and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters.
The first verses of the Bible set the tone. The purpose of God is to create order from chaos. This makes God unapologetically Masculine.
Every good masculine archetype emphasises the alignment with Order over against Chaos.
The masculine purpose is to work with God to create order out of chaos.
This work is specifically and intuitively masculine.
We live in a society with a serious problem: the suppression of the masculine instinct. Our institutions have suffered from a ‘long walk’ of Leftists with a Feminist ideology inserting themselves at key nodes within hierarchies. These Leftists then use the power of the institutions to enforce a gender ideology that seeks to eliminate the Masculine.
All cultures have traditions that teach boys how to become men. The Leftists have used their positions of power to destroy our versions of these traditions.
When I was a boy I went to an all-male Church of England high school where we sang hymns such as Fight the Good Fight and To Be A Pilgrim. Feminists have taken over the Church of England hierarchy and feminised it so that such hymns have been banished.
The masculine virtues were embedded in the culture of my school but schools these days have jettisoned such politically incorrect virtues.
In a previous era of masculine crisis, Lord Baden Powell started the Boy Scouts. His organisation is now open to girls.
Boys now need new guidance on how to become men.
Jordan B Peterson has made some excellent lectures and written a well-needed book subtitles an antidote to chaos but he does not go far enough because he is still in the Enlightenment Liberal mode of thinking.
There is a deeper, broader truth that boys need to know:
The Masculine spirit is about creating order from chaos in a way that is in harmony with the essence or nature of things and is done with and in love.
To understand and unpack that, in my next few blogs I will be working through some passages from the Bible and classical literature.

Chapter 1 – Never-ending Nightmares
Someone wakes up in a dark room with two doors. One has a glass design of a naked male with blue flowers surrounding him while the other has a design of a naked female who is surrounded by red roses. The unknown individual walks through the female door and is presented by another set of two doors with one label yes and the other no.
“Do you know who you are?” a feminine voice asks.
The individual walks through the “Yes” door and a girl with markings on her body grabs the person and throws them into a pit of hands that grab them and pull them in while sinking them into a deep abyss.
A woman wakes up in her bed, sweaty and afraid.
She shakes off her feelings of fear and says, “Just another damn nightmare.”
She takes her medication then throws away the empty bottle.
“And these shitty medications don’t help.”
Her name is Rose, she’s twenty-five years old, and isn’t really anything special. She works as an accountant at a bank while living in an apartment in a city called Hillside City. She doesn’t talk to her family and only has one friend a man by the name of Richard. Today is another normal day for work so she gets dressed and walks to her job. Along the way, things get strange as the morning sky becomes cloudy and the city foggy. The people who rush to work in cars, buses, and on foot see to vanish in the fog leaving Rose to walk the streets alone and confused. She tries to ignore what’s happening and keeps walking forward. Further into the fog, dark figures are seen on the edge of the fog but don’t physically appear. What can only be described as a rusty machine is heard as Rose continues her way to work and as she gets closer, the fog seems to consume her, but as she enters the bank, everything goes back to normal. Rose checks outside to see if everything is normal and she sees the busy people that she was supposed to be seeing and the other people who walk the streets but didn’t. She then immediately goes to her desk and takes her medication again that she keeps in her desk in case of emergencies.
Richard, a close friend of Rose, who has brown eyes, hair, and wears black clothes, with a red tie, approaches her and says, “Hey, how are you doing?”
“Just fine. You?”
“Really? Because I just saw you taking your pills. Don’t you take them at home?”
“Yes, but a normal dose doesn’t help.”
“Well try not to overdose alright?”
“Alright.”
Suddenly, three armed robbers disguised in clown masks come in, shoot the guards, and demand money. Everyone including Rose and Richard get down as one of the robbers explain that they’re robbing the bank to get revenge on the government.
One person gets up in protest and says, “Then why involve us in it you pieces of shit?! You’re not only gonna hurt them, but you’re going to hurt us as well!”
The person gets shot in the leg and the crowd screams in fear.
The robber then says, “Now if anyone else wants to end up being shot then you have permission to speak.”
‘These guys are such assholes’, Rose thinks to herself, ‘Thankfully I actually have something to deal with them.’
She pulls out a high-powered magnum that she carries around in case of emergencies from her desk and crawls under her desk as she aims at the robbers’ legs and shoots them with one bullet that knocks down all of them. Once they are down, the crowd pounces on them, knocking their weapons away and beat them up. One of them activates an explosion that blows up certain parts of the bank like some of the walls and the ceiling. Everyone in the bank scatter as they leave the bank just as the police arrive. They pull out the robbers of the collapsing building and arrest them.
Rose watches her only source of income be destroyed right in front of her and feels the anger and headaches she has get worse.
“Well this is turning out to be a great day isn’t it?” says Richard.
“If great means absolutely terrible, then yes. Today is a great day.”
Rose starts to walk away and Richard follows her.
“Oh come on. Something like this always happens in this city.”
“But did it really have to happen to our job? I mean really as if I didn’t have enough to worry about.”
“That’s how it is though. Some people think only for themselves and end up ruining the lives of others.”
“…”
“Hey since I didn’t really get a chance to get breakfast, do you want to eat without with me?”
“Sure. I got nothing better to do.”
“Cool.”
The two go to a nearby diner and sit down and order what they want. While waiting for their dishes to arrive, Rose doses off and wakes up in a dark area with the dinner table and chair she sits at still there except there is a lighter and a flashlight.
‘Where the Hell am I?’ Rose thinks to herself as she picks up the lighter and flashlight, ‘Is this another nightmare?’
She wanders the abyss with the flashlight on as rain falls from the empty sky. She follows dark marks on the ground that seem to be arrows that lead her to a maze-like area made of corroded concrete. Movement can be heard in the maze as Rose moves forward along with the shadows of what look to be monsters can be seen moving away from her as if they are stalking her. As Rose keeps moving through the maze, the noise of movement grow louder and louder until it suddenly stops. Rose stops walking as she looks around and when she turns around, she sees a horrible looking monster that has the face of the robber’s masks and chains that go through its body. It swings at her as soon as she looks at it and breaks the flashlight that she is holding, which hurts her arm and causes her to run. She runs away from the monster as it chases her. It moves considerably fast despite the bullet wound in its leg, but Rose manages to get away with enough sharp turns. Rose sits down on the floor and takes a quick rest while holding her arm.
‘Ah! That thing really hit my arm really hard’, she thinks to herself.
Rose searches for her magnum on herself, but can’t manage to find it.
‘Damn it! I thought I still had it with me. Did I lose it? Whatever I just have to worry about getting out of here.’
She uses the lighter to light her way as she makes her way through the maze. It doesn’t give as much light as the flashlight, but it’s better than nothing. After making her way further into the maze, she stumbles into the monster again. She jolts back a little but quickly notices that it hasn’t noticed her yet despite being so close to it. It moves closer to her, but she tries to keep the same distance away from it as it moves past and away from her.
‘So that’s how it is. I just gotta keep a good distance away from them with the lighter, but I still can barely see anything.’
After a little more wandering, she finds a sees a light ahead and starts to run towards it and as she does, she hears the sound of footsteps chasing her. She picks up her pace as the light grows brighter and the footsteps grow louder. The bright light envelops her as she continues to run, giving her the hope that she’s escaping. As Rose thinks she’s at the exit, she looks behind her and sees the monster that is chasing her. It isn’t the monster from before. It’s something different, something indescribable. The monster reaches out for Rose and grabs her shoulder.
“Hey Rose.”
Rose wakes up in the dinner she was at before with Richard.
“Breakfast is here,” says Richard.
“Oh…cool,” Rose says as she shakes off what happened.
 
 

Chapter 2 – Another Day, Another Nightmare
As they eat breakfast, Richard says that, “So anyways. We’ve lost our jobs.”
“Thanks for reminding me, captain obvious.”
“So what are you going to do?”
“I doubt that the other banks have openings for accountants so we can’t get back into the positions we studied for in college.”
“Oh God don’t even mention college to me.”
“What? You still hate that?”
“Of course I do. I always told you how much I hate people going to it and not getting the jobs they want or when they do they get jobs that don’t pay that much.”
“Speaking about that, we should probably get a desk job in the meantime.”
“Man I hate that kind of job.”
“Like being a bank accountant is any different?”
“Hey, at least we got paid more.”
“True.”
“But who am I kidding I guess. We need a job to support us in the meantime. Maybe they’ll be a bank accountant job so we don’t need to worry about the desk job.”
Rose stares out the window while thinking about anything else she can do to fix the situation she’s in, but nothing comes to mind.
Richard interrupts her thoughts, “That was a really brave thing you did you know.”
“I guess so. I was just doing what I thought was right.”
“Well, it was right. I mean, I wish I had your magnum.”
“Why? It’s not like you’ll use it often.”
“I know, but it’s still handy to have especially in a city like this.”
“I guess you’re right.”
The waitress brings them the receipt.
“Hey, this’ll be on me,” says Richard.
“Thanks. I gotta go home and get some rest.”
“You do that and don’t forget about what I said about the medication.”
“I know I know, you tell me all the time.”
“There’s a reason why you know.”
“I know. Thanks for caring about me.”
“No problem.”
“See you.”
“See you later!”
Rose leaves the dinner and a girl, with purple hair and a pink shirt with a butterfly on it, approaches her.
She says, “Hello there stranger. I overheard you talking about medication. Now you know that over the counter medicine doesn’t work that well so may I offer you something better?”
“Suuuurrrre, but who are you?”
“My name is Maria and I can get you the best medicine in this city.”
“How? What are you some kind of drug dealer?”
“I like to think of myself as a “street pharmacist”.”
“Right…”
“Here,” Maria gives Rose a piece of paper with an address on it, “Come to this address later this afternoon if you’re interested.”
“And what if I’m not interested?”
“And listen to your girl friend?”
“He’s not a girl!”
“He sure sounded like one with the way he talked. How long have you known him anyway?”
“I uhhh…a while.”
“See? That crappy over the counter medication is guess what? Crap. It’s making you forget things.”
“Won’t your medication do the same thing?”
“Maybe, but it’ll definitely make you feel better.”
“Hmmm, I’ll think about it.”
Rose goes home, changes into casual clothes, and thinks about what to do.
‘I could be applying for a job now…but I already have a copy of my application on my computer. All I have to do is send it out and I’m good. Maybe going to see Maria is a good idea. I do need a better kind of medication so I guess it wouldn’t hurt to try what she has.’
Rose goes to the address where Maria is supposed to be and she finds her waiting outside. Maria smiles at her and gives her a hug.
Maria says, “I know you would choose the right decision. Come in my friend.”
They go into the house and there’s a person by a curtain with a list of sorts in his hand.
He asks Rose, “What’s your name?”
“It’s-”
“The Stranger,” Maria interrupts.
“Hey, that’s not my name!”
“It’s your name here,” She whispers in Rose’s ear, “We don’t use our real names just in case the cops hear us outside.”
“Alright, so what’s your name here?”
“Judy Nails.”
“Nice name.”
“I know right?”
They go past the curtain and see a small marketplace set up inside the medium sized house full of people buying medication. Maria gets in front of the line and gets Rose a small bottle of their own medication, which enough for a week.
“Thanks,” says Rose.
“No problem.”
“How much do I owe you?”
“Nothing. It’s on me.”
“Oh…you sure? I can pay you now if you want.”
“No, it’s fine. What I want is your number and address. I’ll give you mine too.”
“What for?”
“We’re friends now, aren’t we?”
“Uh, I guess.”
“Awesome!”
They exchange info.
“So do you want to stay for the party later tonight?” says Maria.
“No thanks. I gotta go home and get some rest.”
“Alright, I understand. Good night.”
“Good night.”
Rose leaves the building, goes home to her apartment, and applies for a job at a nearby office building and other banks. She doesn’t get a response from the bank, but she does get an interview at the office building. She hasn’t tried Maria’s medication yet just in case any of the jobs do drug tests and there happens to be something illegal in the medication. Once there, Rose’s college degree, experience at work, and sympathy for losing her job get her the job. At her first day of work, Richard runs into her when she’s working.
“Hey there,” he says.
“Hey, I didn’t know that you worked here.”
“I just got the job.”
“Me too.”
“That’s awesome. I guess we can’t be separated right?”
“Haha, that’s right.”
“Alright well, I’m going to get to work. I got lots to do.”
“Same.”
Rose works hard throughout the day and thinks to herself, ‘Now I know why Richard wanted to avoid this job.’ Since her coworkers aren’t the nicest and the work can be really tiring. ‘At least at the bank it was quiet and all we had was Richard and I working as accountants.’
At the end of the day as Rose leaves work, she sees Richard.
“Hey Rose!” he says as he runs to catch up to her.
“Hey.”
“Now do you see why I didn’t want this job?”
“Yeah, I was thinking that to myself earlier.”
“We definitely need to get better jobs.”
“Did you see if any banks need accountants?”
“Yeah, but I haven’t gotten any responses and the ones I have say they don’t need people like us.”
“Damn.”
“It looks like we’re gonna have to get used to this.”
“Or we could go back to college if you’d like.”
“Oh God no! I still haven’t paid my debts yet and I have to worry about my apartment bills among other things.”
“Alright then. It’s just a suggestion.”
“It’s a terrible one that you said because you know that it pisses me off.”
“I do.”
“You’re such an asshole!”
Rose and Richard laugh together and go their separate ways as they go back to their apartment rooms. Once Rose get ready for bed, she decides to take Maria’s medication. The nightmares she’s been having, haven’t been changing so she hopefully thinks this will changes things. In the dream, she wakes up at her job, but the lights are out and it’s night time.
‘What the? Did I accidentally fall asleep at work?’
This thought instantly goes away as she sees the monster from before with another one of its kind walks through a door and into the office space and look around the area, but they don’t seem to see her despite the amount of light in the room.
‘Hmm. Maybe the medication is actually helping…hmm?’
Rose notices that she has her magnum with her.
‘It’s defiantly helping.’
She checks the gun.
‘I only have three out of six bullets, but this is plenty.’
Rose then takes aim at the closest monster and shoots it in the head. It is not fazed by the first bullet, but the second one is what puts it down. The second monster has seemingly vanished when Rose looks around for it.
‘That’s right. You better run away. Now, where’s the exit.’
As she looks around the office building for the exit, she finds her coworkers looking like weird monster like-people who are chained to the desk with their eyes lids pulled open as they continuously work. Rose avoids them and enters the bathroom to see if there’s anything there and in it she sees a bloody handprint on the mirror. She goes up to it and as she touches it, it grabs her and tries pulls her in. She resists and eventually pulls out a rusty pipe from it.
“You’ll need it,” a voice says.
“What? Who’s there?”
Rose doesn’t get an answer, but the monster she shot down before barges through the door. She shoots it, but like before, it doesn’t go down in one shot so Rose instead beats it down with the pipe. It falls down and violently shakes on the floor as it makes noises distorted by the blood coming out of its mouth and eyes. Rose runs away and is now in a different office space than the one she was in before she entered the bathroom. There’s a window at the other end of the room that is lit up and the second monster from before is patrolling this room and Rose’s magnum is empty so she decides to sneak around it. She tries to use the cubicles as cover, but her nightmarish coworkers don’t like this and they scream out, which gets the attention of the monster. Rose runs for the exit with it directly behind her and as she gets to the exit, it tackles her through it. She wakes up in her room all sweaty and out of breath so she gets up from her bed, but as she does the monster from her nightmare punches a hole in her chest from behind. Rose wakes up again in the same state, but no monster attacks her.
She throws her elephant plush at the door and says, “I can’t fucking take this shit anymore!”
She stares at its eyes that are staring back at her and gets up to pick it up.
“I’m sorry,” she says as she holds it.
 
 
 

Chapter 3 – Finding Relief
There’s a knock at Rose’s door and when she answers it, she sees Richard.
“Hey what are you doing here this early?” Rose says.
“I was thinking that…ummm.”
“You got our plans for this weekend?”
“No, I was thinking you should go to the psychiatrist.”
“Wow really?”
“I’m sorry if it seems that you’re crazy, but it seems that this is the best way to get rid of your nightmares since your medication barely helps.”
“Hmmm, you may be right.”
“Here,” he gives her a piece of paper, “Call this number and schedule an appointment. I know this guy he’s pretty good.”
“Thanks.”
“No problem.”
“And…Richard?”
“Yeah?”
“I’m sorry I forgot, but how long have I known you?”
“Since college.”
“Alright. Thanks for reminding me. Again sorry I forgot.”
“It’s fine. Hey, you still have your elephant plush?”
Rose notices that she’s still holding her elephant.
“Uh…yes.”
“What did you name it again? Elephanty?”
“Yeah,” Rose embarrassingly says because of the name.
“Ha! Well, I think it’s a cute name for a cute elephant,” Richard pets it, “I’ll see you later.”
“See you.”
Rose looks at the piece of paper Richard gave her then there’s another knock at the door.
“Hi,” says Maria.
“Maria? What are you doing here?”
“I stopped here to see how you’re doing.”
“I’m fine thanks. How are you?”
“Alright. Did you try the medication I gave you?”
“I tried it last night.”
“And?”
“It helped a little I guess.”
“Good. Do you want to hang out?”
“Uh maybe in a little. I gotta set up an appointment.”
“With the psychiatrist right?”
“Right. How do you know?”
“I heard your conversation with your friend, but I couldn’t catch him for some reason. He must be a fast walker.”
“I don’t think he is. Anyways I gotta make this appointment.”
“If you think it’ll help, go ahead. Just text me what time and where you want to hang out, I got nothing to do.”
“Ok.”
“Oh, and cute elephant plush.”
Maria smiles as she pets it.
“Thanks.”
Rose closes the door as Maria leaves. She makes the appointment for tomorrow and arranges for Maria to meet her at the park in the afternoon after work. When she arrives, she already sees Maria waiting for her on the park bench.
“Hi, Rose. So what do you want to do?”
“We could go to the Shopping Strip.”
“Sounds cool.”
Rose and Maria go to the Shopping Strip, a collection of different shops, stores, and restaurants that go on for more than twenty blocks.
“You know it’s weird how nice places like this are so nice, but others are really bad.”
“Aren’t most cities like that?”
“Yeah, but most don’t have hills on one side and an island on the other.”
“My dad used to work on that island when it used to be an amusement park.”
“Really? That place was one of my favorites to go to as a kid. What was his job?”
“He used to be a security guy and he also fixed the rides and animatronics.”
“Wow, he really knows a lot doesn’t he?”
“Yeah. He even taught me how to use a magnum and how to defend myself.”
“He really sounds like a badass now.”
“He’s awesome. What about your family?”
“What about them?”
“How are you with them?”
“I could care less.”
“Why?”
“Because they do the same to me. All they wanted me to do was be their nurse and take care of them when they grew old.”
“But isn’t that what you’re supposed to do anyway?”
“Yeah, but they made it seem like I was born to take care of them so I ran away from them. They made me feel like a tool and nothing more.”
“Oh, I’m sorry.”
“You don’t have to be sorry. To give them credit though, I wouldn’t be helping people like I am now if they aren’t the way they are.”
“You mean a “street pharmacist”?
“Damn straight. I’m surprised you remember the name I like going by.”
“Well hey, what are friends for right?”
Maria smiles.
“Yeah…right.”
The two shop around and eat dinner out together until late at night until they decide to leave.
“I had a great time today, Rose. Thank you.”
“No problem. Let’s do it again sometime.”
“Oh…alright!”
They say their goodbyes and go back to their homes. On the next day, Rose takes the day off and goes to the psychiatrist as planned. She sits in a comfortable chair as the psychiatrist tries to help her.
“So can you tell me what’s troubling you?”
“The nightmares that I’ve been having and the stress in my life.”
“Do you remember what happens in your nightmares?”
“I’m always being chased by these monsters that have the faces of the masks that the robbers who attacked the bank I work at. I always have my magnum with me in these dreams including a flashlight, lighter, and a rusty pipe, which is the only weapon that seems to kill them while the magnum only slows them down.”
“I heard about a bank being attacked a while ago. I’m sorry for the loss of your job.”
“It’s fine. I’m working at as a regular accountant now.”
“So do you know why this rusty pipe is the only weapon that kills the monsters?”
“No clue.”
“Have you ever killed someone with that weapon?”
“No.”
“Alright. Well, I have an exercise that might help. Close your eyes and imagine the monsters. The real robbers that the monsters are based on are in a hospital in jail so you don’t need to worry about them so I’ll help you fall asleep to face the fake ones.”
“Ok.”
The psychiatrist puts Rose to sleep with hypnosis and she dreams of being in an empty gray space with a question scratched in the wall above her which says, “What is the way out?” There’s also a sliding puzzle with letters on it in front of her, which is supposed to be her answer. She can’t move, but she can move the puzzle pieces by looking at them to try to form words. As she attempts to solve it, the monsters from her dream hit her from behind with their fists. Every hit hurts tremendously, but it also removes a letter from the puzzle, which makes it easier to solve. Rose moves the pieces as fast as she can while enduring the pain. She gets hit over five times before the answer becomes clear. “Let go” is the answer and as she solves it, she wakes up feeling refreshed despite the pain she felt earlier.
“How are you feeling?” the psychiatrist asks.
“I’m feeling better. Thank you.”
“There’s no need to thank me, it’s a pleasure to help people. Don’t forget to come back the next time you have those kinds of nightmares. Your condition might be good now, but it could change later especially with all the stress you have.”
“Ok. I will.”
Rose leaves the psychiatrist, goes home and calls Richard.
“So how did it go?”
“Better than expected.”
“Good to hear. So are you finally going to sleep well?”
“Definitely! You wanna hang out tomorrow?”
“Sure.”
“Awesome. I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
Nighttime arrives and Rose goes to sleep without taking either her medications she has and dreams about being on one of the hills outside the city on a bright summer day. She has a picnic prepared for her friends and here they come. Richard and Maria arrive in the same car and Maria goes to join Rose while Richard unloads the car. Suddenly a car comes out of nowhere and crushes Richard and the grass beneath Maria become spikes and impale her. Rose is shocked by what is happening as the sky turns red and the once green hills turn black as everything around her dies. The ground beneath her gives way and Rose falls into the ground and arrives in a prison with what look to be naked people with black markings on them in prison cells.
“It isn’t over. Far from it,” a mysterious yet familiar voice says.
“Who’s there?”
Rose doesn’t get a response so she wanders the prison until she comes across a door with five panels missing so she searches the prison for them. She finds the first one labeled “D” near a person playing with a dead body as if it was alive. Another labeled “A” is found in a room with a dead person with a caved in face while another stands above them with a bloodied prison bar. “B” and “D” is found in a room with a person turning their skin inside out and the last labeled “A” is found in a room with a frame that seems to be giving light to someone standing in front of it. Rose puts the panels in order she found them in the door, which unlocks it. She goes through it and it leads it to a staircase that goes to the ground floor and on it she chooses to go through a door that seems to be the exit. The door bursts open, knocking back Rose. A person who looks like Rose walks out the door with the same markings that the people in the prison have. Her eyes are black bloodshot and she looks to be pissed.
“Fucking idiot, you’re going the wrong way!” the other Rose says.
Rose runs to the other door as the other her chases her. The way into the door suddenly now has spikes, fire, and crushing traps that Rose avoids as she makes her way to the exit. She gets out of the prison and is back at the hill she was previously at. The other her finally catches up to her by tackling her. It gets up and picks up Rose by the neck.
“You stupid bitch. You’re not done yet,” the other her says before throwing Rose down a never-ending hole.
Rose then wakes up in the morning feeling as if the treatment she went through didn’t help at all.
 
 
 
 

Chapter 4 – Together Forever
Rose grabs her phone and calls Richard.
“Good morning sunshine. Did you sleep well?”
“Fuck no.”
“Oh, I see. Well, it’s to be expected. You usually need to go there more than once with a condition like yours.”
“That shit’s expense though!”
“Well, maybe you need another solution.”
“And what might that be?”
“Have you ever thought of being in a relationship?”
“…Are you saying what I think you’re saying?”
“Not really. I’m just saying you might need someone in your life to help you.”
“I don’t know.”
“Just think about it. Are we still good to hang out today?”
“Yeah.”
“Cool. I’ll see you later then.”
“Alright.”
Rose and Richard meet each other in the afternoon. They go to a nearby park to do stress relieving exercises.
“You know this barely helps right?” says Rose.
“Right, but it’s better than it doing nothing.”
“Oh come on, admit it. You’re just doing it to try to impress the ladies aren’t you?”
“Maybe.”
“Well, you have to do more to impress.”
Rose uses her foot to extend Richard’s stretch, which makes him do a painful split.
“Hahaha!”
“Pain isn’t funny!”
“It is when it happens to someone else.”
“Really? I didn’t know that.”
Richard turns Rose around, who is on the ground, and stretches her legs behind her back as if he was doing a wrestling move.
“Ow ow ow!”
“Hahaha! You’re right! It is funny!”
“Oh fuck you!”
They continue to stretch and do exercises until they decide to rest by eating lunch underneath a tree.
“So is anything new going on?” asks Rose.
“New as in?”
“I don’t know. How’s your family?”
“What family? As far as I know, I don’t have one.”
“Oh, I’m sorry I forgot-”
“Those assholes and everyone else always doubted my ability to do things and look who proved them wrong. I can live by myself without anyone’s help.”
“You know everyone I seem to know has a bad family or views them as bad?”
“Really? You’re friends with someone then just me?”
“Yeah.”
“I feel bad for them.”
“Well her name is Maria and she’s a “street pharmacist”.”
“You mean a drug dealer?”
“She likes going by the title “street pharmacist”. She makes her own kind of medication with a few of her friends to help people in need.”
“You need to watch yourself around people like her. You remember the trouble I had to go through to get drugs for certain people at our college parties.”
“Yeah and that was stupid for you to do.”
“And what do to you think it is for you?”
“It’s not like that. Maria is a really nice person and-”
“Hey, I’m not saying she’s not a nice person I’m just saying to watch yourself. Alright?”
“Ok.”
“Speaking about college, do you remember what we did there?”
“How can you not?! Booze, babes, and a huge fucking hangover…from studying a lot. But if you’re asking about what we learned, I barely remember shit. I swear we wasted two semesters or more on classes that we needed to take to get the degree, but those classes didn’t teach us crap that we needed for the job.”
“I hear ya.”
“Hey didn’t I say that I hate talking about college?”
“Yup.”
“So why are we talking about it?”
“Because I love bothering the shit out of you.”
Richard stares at Rose’s smiling face for a second.
“Fuck you bitch.”
“No, fuck you bitch.”
The two play fight with each other for a while until it comes time to leave. They laugh over their fight and say goodbye to each other as they head back to their apartment rooms. Rose falls asleep and is sucked into her bed without her knowing and she awakens on a small patch of grass at night outside a maze made of thorns. There’s no way to go besides into the maze because she’s there isn’t any ground around the spot she’s standing on so she walks into the maze of thorns. She checks to see if she has anything and she has the usual items she carries in her dreams; a lighter, flashlight, rusty pipe, and her magnum with six bullets that seem to refill with every dream.
‘Damn this maze is tight and the thorns don’t help either.’
She uses her flashlight as she usually does for now until thinks a monster is nearby. Suddenly she hears a yelling sound from above and sees a ceiling of thorns fall down from the sky, which makes Rose duck and forces her to crouch to get through the maze.
‘God this sucks!’
A crackling noise is heard in the distance and Rose quickly switches to her lighter.
‘Maybe I can use my lighter to get rid of these thorns…Nah, I’ll just end up burning myself alive. Now, let’s see what new monster is coming for me.’
Rose carefully makes sure to not make the lighter touch the ground or the thorns as she goes through the maze and keeps an eye out for whatever is lurking in the darkness. The maze is more cumbersome to walk through now and the ceiling seems to be pushing itself closer to Rose. A shadow is seen in the distance that keeps making paths by breaking through the thorns by darting through them. Rose decides to go through these paths while keeping her lighter in one hand and gun ready in the other. The shadow continuously gets closer and closer every time she seems it pass by her until she sees exactly what it is. It looks like the other her, but its eyes and mouth are stretched out and the mark on its chest and back are different. As soon as it knows it’s seen, it runs away back into the maze.
‘Good. It’s too shy to directly attack me.’
But not shy to attack at all, as Rose makes her way further into the maze and she fails to turn to face it fast enough. It transforms into a giant mouth with big teeth and a tongue that grabs Rose’s leg and tries to pull her in. She shoots it’s throat a few times before it lets go and scurries away. Rose then picks up the pace as the monster as increased its aggressive nature and approaches her more frequently.
‘There! The exit!’
She sees that the exit of the maze and also the monster behind her. It doesn’t run away even though it’s noticed so Rose gets the idea to light the maze on fire to make it collapse on the monster. Everything around her starts to collapse and burn at a fast rate, but Rose manages to crawl out of and onto her bed.
She sighs then says, “Just another crazy nightmare.”
“It was an exciting nightmare!” a cartoony voice says.
Rose looks around her room and doesn’t see where the voice could’ve come from. All she sees is her plush elephant, which seems to be staring at her.
 
 
 

Chapter 5 – Bigger Problems
As Rose recovers from her newest nightmare, she receives a call from her mother.
“Hello, mom.”
“Hello, how have you’ve been doing?”
“Fine, you?”
“Alone with nobody to care for me.”
“Goddammit, mom you know why that is. Is this why you called?”
“No, it’s not. I wanted to see how you were doing.”
“Since when did you start caring about me?”
“Since you were born my dear. Why do you give me an attitude?”
“Because you kicked me out of the house for a stupid ass reason!”
“I did no such thing you kicked yourself out!”
“How? By trying to help our family’s financial problems?”
“No, by not giving enough time to visit and take care of me.”
“Mom, the job I had was very busy. I’m sorry I couldn’t find a whole lot of time to be there, but I tried to visit you at least once or twice a week, but that’s not enough for you because you put yourself on a fucking pedestal because you’re my mom. Am I right?”
“N-”
“No one not even dad tried hard enough in your opinion because you ask too much of a guy that worked his hands to dust and what’s this bullshit that you cared about since birth if you didn’t call me or anything after I lost my job?!”
“It’s because I was busy upstate.”
“What? Too busy drinking and looking for men. Pfft. Please do me a favor and never call me again if you really care about me. Goodbye.”
Rose hangs up her phone and throws it at her couch. She doesn’t like talking about her mother as before her mom lost her job, she was a pretty nice mom, but after that, her mom turned to drinking and looking for others to care for her because she didn’t think her friends and family did enough. Rose’s father tried his best to help her find a job, but jobs were hard to find in the economic situation in the country so the family grew poor and couldn’t have fun vacations or travel, but they did barely manage to get up thanks to her father and his job as a car mechanic. There’s a knock at the door and Rose answers it to see Maria.
“Hi there,” Maria says.
“Hey. Come in.”
Maria enters the apartment and looks around.
“You can sit if you want. You don’t need to ask.”
“Are you alright? You seem mad.”
“It’s fine. I just talked to my bitchy mom.”
“Really? And I was thinking that you had a happy family since you seem so nice.”
“My dad is the reason I’m any kind of nice.”
“The guy who taught you how to use a gun taught you how to be nice, alright.”
“I’m serious. Even though there’s something weird about him, he’s a really nice guy.”
“I can’t wait to meet him one day.”
“I can’t wait to visit him. He’s just busy now and he said he’ll call me when he’s free.”
“Awesome.”
“So what’s brings you here today?”
“I was just stopping by to see if you needed a refill if you know what I mean.”
“Oh, the medication? I occasionally take it so I’m still good for a few days.”
“Alright.”
“Do you want to hang out today?”
“I uh sure,” Maria says in with a surprised expression.
“What’s wrong?”
“Nothing. It’s just that most of my friends are all business and “other” related so it’s kind of weird to me for someone to ask me to hang out as a normal thing, but anyways sure let’s hang out.”
“Awesome.”
The two hang out for a while on the town and discuss current events, TV shows, music, and games until night time when the two part ways and go home. At home, Rose takes a look at her phone and realizes that she missed a call from her dad so she immediately calls him back and hopes that she isn’t bothering him at work.
“Hey dad I’m sorry I missed your call.”
“It’s fine Rosey. How are you doing?”
“I’m good, you?”
“Good now since I’m hearing your voice. I’m sorry I haven’t had the time to answer your calls and set up a time so we can be together.”
“No, it’s fine dad don’t worry about it. I know how busy you are.”
“Alright, but I still feel bad about it. So how’s Elephanty by the way? Is he taking good care of you?”
“Haha, he’s good. He tucks me in at night and keeps the monsters away.”
“Hahaha good to hear! I’ll talk to you later Rosey. I had a big day at work today so I’ve got to get some sleep.”
“Ok good night. I love you, dad.”
“Love you too Rosey.”
Rose hangs up the phone and feels better after having talked to her dad.
“I’ll protect you “Rosey”. Just as your father did,” a cartoony voice says.
The voice seems to be coming from her plush that is sitting on her bed, which is strange because it wasn’t there when she left. Rose goes to sleep and like every night, awakens in another time, but this time the entire space is lit up with a giant monster that is sitting on at the end of the maze and holding a bottle of alcohol.
‘Holy shit. Well, that’s different.’
She quickly runs through the maze while the monster yells out and attacks Rose. The attacks are slow, but they are powerful enough to break not only the maze walls but the floor as well. While going through the maze, there are levers in certain rooms that Rose pulls, without knowing what they do, that pour liquor into the monster’s bottle and distracts it for a while as it drinks it. Another monster comes out of nowhere and tries to seemingly stop it from drinking, but it ends up getting hit with the bottle. After getting to the end of the maze, Rose sees that the monster is blocking the exit.
“Fucking fat piece of shit, move!”
The monster from before gets up and stops it before it attacks Rose and pulls it out of the way, letting Rose leave the nightmare and enter back into her room. She gets up from her bed and goes to the kitchen to make breakfast, but she is quickly tackled by the other her.
“You have to stop this nightmare!” it says, “Stop living in this cycle!”
“What are you talking about it? Get off me!”
“You keep living this so-called normal life and if you don’t do anything to change, your stress will destroy you.”
Rose then wakes up after wrestling the blankets off her.
“What the Hell was that crazy bitch talking about?”
 
 
 

Chapter 6 – Someone New
Rose goes to work as usual on a weekday, but on this day so is approached by a random coworker at break time.
“Hey there,” he says to Rose.
“Hey.”
“What’s up?”
“Nothing. Is there something you need?”
“No, I just wanted to talk to you.”
Rose blushes a little.
“Why?”
“You’re usually alone and don’t really talk to anyone.”
“I talk to people. There’s my friend Richard who works here.”
“Richard? I didn’t hear of any Richards working here.”
“You haven’t seen him? He wears a dark gray shirt with black pants and a red tie. He also has brown eyes and hair.”
“Nope. Doesn’t ring a bell.”
“Weird. I usually see him every day. So why exactly are you talking to me?”
“Because you seem to be the most normal person here and you look cute.”
Rose blushes again.
“What’s your name?”
“Rose, what’s yours?”
“Travis, it’s nice to meet you.”
“Same to you.”
“You wanna hang out after work?”
“Sure.”
“Sounds great.”
After work, Rose gets together with Travis and go out to dinner at a nice bar restaurant.
“So how long have you worked at this job?” Rose asks.
“Not too long, but long enough to know most of the people.”
“I only started to work here a week ago after the place I worked at got destroyed.”
“You mean you worked at that bank that got blown up?”
“Yep.”
“That’s amazing that you survived that.”
“I guess, but it sucks that I had to find a different one because of it.”
“Did your friend Richard work there with you?”
“He did. We went to college together.”
“Oh, so do you have a lot of friends?”
“Nah I just have two. What about you?”
“I don’t really have any. I mean I have a really big and supporting family, but friends are a thing I’m lacking in.”
“Really? It’s the exact opposite with the people I know.”
“That’s weird isn’t family supposed to be good by default?”
“Yeah and so are friends, but it isn’t always like that with some people.”
“That’s true, isn’t it? Wow, I didn’t expect to learn something today from someone I just met.”
“Well hey, friends teach each other things too you know?”
“I know now.”
The two split the bill and leave the restaurant.
“Tonight was nice,” says Rose.
“It was.”
“You want to hang out again sometime?”
“Sure. I’d like that.”
They say their goodbyes and go back to their homes. Rose goes to sleep and awakens in a field of roses in morning daylight. As she looks around, she notices the other version of the other her in the distance. She draws her magnum and slowly approaches it as she watches it wander around the field. The monster seems to be searching for something, but it also doesn’t seem to care for Rose who it probably already saw. Another monster rises from the roses, one that looks like a male version of the other, and they seem to like each other. One of their arms and legs fall off as they connect their bodies to one another. The two now one monster walk off in the distance.
“Aww it looks like someone has a crush,” someone says behind Rose.
She then wakes up in bed with her elephant right beside her.
 
 
 

Chapter 7 – The Ugly Side of a Best Friend
Another day, another day of work is ahead of Rose today as she does her daily routine, but today she notices something different. Her elephant friend seems to be following her around today with it appearing in buses, store windows, and in the hands of the homeless people she passes by on the streets. She tries to ignore this and say to herself that she sees it because the plush is a popular one. This mindset gets Rose through most of the sightings of her favorite plush until she sees it at work, sitting on her desk. It stares at her as if it was expecting her and its eyes seem to follow her.
Travis puts his hand on Rose’s shoulder and asks her, “You have one of those elephant plushies too?”
“I do. I’ve seen them everywhere.”
“So did you just buy that one? I saw you walking in with it.”
Rose nods her head sideways.
“I was?”
“You were. I saw you carrying it when I got here.”
“Hmm. That’s weird. I thought I left at home. Anyways, my dad got this for me when I was little.”
“Really? Did you give it a name?”
“I – uh…yes. It’s…Elephanty.”
“Elephanty huh? That’s a cute name.”
“Thank you.”
Travis smiles and walks away.
“You think he’s cute don’t ya?” a dark voice says.
“I guess.”
“Well, he can’t have you.”
“What are you-”
Rose looks around and doesn’t see anyone who could’ve been talking to her. She looks down at her elephant and it seems to have darkened and its eyes are staring dead at her. She then puts it down at her desk as she keeps an eye on it and it keeps its eyes locked on her. After taking a shower and eating dinner, she goes to bed.
“He can’t have you!” a dark voice yells as the ground shakes, “I won’t allow it!”
Rose wakes up in a padded room with a demented version of her elephant. Its appearance is split in half, but its overall look is that of a butcher.
Confused and shocked, Rose says, “El…Elephanty?”
“That’s me and you’re mine.”
It pulls a huge cleaver out of its back and swings at Rose. She backs up and takes out her gun.
“You can’t leave me. You won’t leave me. I’ll cut your legs off before you do so you can stay with me forever,” the demented elephant says.
Rose empties her gun into the monster, but it isn’t affected at all by it so Rose uses the rusty pipe on it. The pipe is able to block and deflect the swings by the cleaver and Rose even manages to bring the monster down with a few good hits that she manages to get in.
As Rose stares at the bloodied monster that was her first best friend, it says to her, “I love you, Rose. Please don’t kill me.”
She somehow feels sympathy for the nightmarish monster and walks away from it. A door appears in the room, which leads to her job. Elephanty gets up and follows Rose.
“I’ll protect you no matter what Rose. You’re my bestest friend.”
“Uh alright then.”
As Rose goes through the building, there are switches that change the floors in the building so she can get to different parts in it. The switches are activated by answering =, =/, =?, or =?! to some questions such as; help___inconceivable, monsters___me, and suicide___possible answer. A new monster appears in this nightmare that is made by of nightmarish versions of her coworkers that are all part of the same body, but they fight for the top as they claw and tear each other of their own body.
“I’ll handle this,” Elephanty says as it walks in front of Rose, “You’re not gonna hurt my best friend!”
Elephanty fights the monster with its cleaver and chops it up into pieces.
“See? I told you that I would protect you.”
“Thanks.”
“You don’t need to thank me. This is what best friends do for each other.”
Its already big smile widens as it attempts to show a comforting smile.
“What? Am I too creepy?”
“Kinda.”
“I’m sorry.”
Rose manages to find the key to the exit after shifting the building for a while and wakes up next to her elephant plush who is back to normal.
“That was so much fun! I can wait to do it again!” it cheerfully says.
Or at least mostly normal.

Title: Tyrannical Patriarchy or Co-operative Patriarchy?
Author: Rob Scovell
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/10/12/tyrannical-patriarchy-or-co-operative-patriarchy/
Category: Uncategorized
Date: October 12, 2018
Entry: 
Feminism is based on a half-truth: Patriarchy has reigned supreme for the entire history of peoplekind and in every culture.
The half-lie is this: Patriarchy is inherently tyrannical and must therefore be destroyed.
Feminism reveals to us that the human condition is patriarchal. However, if it is always as tyrannical as they believe, then why did the rebellion against it only start in the 1800s? (It will not surprise the astute reader to learn that Feminism emerged from the energies of the French Revolution.)
It was the extraordinary events around the Kavanaugh confirmation process that triggered me to start blogging on Feminism and the thoughts I have been having since I first encountered it nearly 30 years ago.
The final scene of the final act of that drama saw women banging inchoately and futilely against the heavy oak doors of the Supreme Court. This scene was more than symbolic: it was rage against what they saw as a tyrannical Patriarchy that was out to deny the women their validity.
I have blogged before about the tyranny of Feminism. This article is about the tyrannical potential in Patriarchy. I believe that the most ardent feminists are those who have experienced tyrannical fathers and who have inherited their tyrannical natures, either through their genes or through their modelling. Indeed, I have observed this in Feminists I have known. They resent the tyrannical power of their family Patriarch but also desire to have it for themselves. This dynamic in their psyches allows them to be victim-tyrants or cry-bullies.
Given that the human condition does appear to be patriarchal, what should we do about it? Railing against it and trying to change it through forced cultural engineering simply leads to social fracturing and serious familial distress.
This is where we need the Bible and the orthodox traditions that are consistent with the Bible tradition. The Bible is not simply an old book of random rules but an ancient tradition, perhaps the oldest extant tradition, that reveals patterns of how we should orientate ourselves with regard to Reality (to borrow an expression from Jordan B Peterson).
The Bible tradition is against tyranny of any kind, so we can quickly see that both tyrannical Patriarchy and tyrannical Feminism are out of sync with the the Bible.
The story of the Book of Ruth provides an excellent model for how a non-tyrannical Patriarchy can work.
In conclusion: smashing the Patriarchy and replacing it with tyrannical Feminism runs against the human condition as we experience it and as revealed in the Bible; trying to impose a tyrannical Patriarchy also runs against the Bible tradition. The only kind of Patriarchy that can work is one that is voluntary and co-operative and based on mutual care and respect.

Title: Steve McRae, Abuser of Child Rape Survivors, Calls Red Pill Religion “Morally Bankrupt”
Author: Max Kolbe
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/10/12/steve-mcrae-child-rape-victim-abuser-calls-red-pill-religion-morally-bankrupt/
Category: Atheist Challenges
Date: October 12, 2018
Entry: 
Steve McRae, a well-known professional hater of Christians & Believing Jews, has recently morally condemned the Red Pill Religion team. 
Problem 1: This is a man whoo has insulted multiple Red Pill Religion team members who are Child Sex Abuse survivors. He also routinely trades in demonstrable pseudoscience, demonstrable pseudohistory, and demonstrable lies about the nature of religious belief and its history. Why would anyone care about such a man’s moral condemnation?
Problem 2: McRae and his group of ideological fellow travelers and hangers-on are also people who routinely deny that there is any objective morality anyway.
So our answer to McRae and his fellow moralizing bullying cultists and pseudoscholars is simple: you have no moral leg to stand on condemning anyone. You mock, abuse, and marginalize the vast majority of the world’s Child Rape victims, you use and abuse other Child Rape survivors to score political points, and you routinely hang out with pseudoscientists and pseudohistorians peddling easily debunked, propagandistic garbage.
As a child molestation survivor myself–at the hands of Secular authorities–I have no particular distress being morally condemned by McRae, or his friends/groupies. These are people who pretend to be nice but will lie about you or mischaracterize you and even insult you, publicly, when you’re not there to defend yourself. These are people who routinely mute, or mock, anyone who challenges their views in any serious way. They are people who pretend to represent “Science” when they routinely get contemporary mainstream science wrong, and who pretend to represent “empathy” and being “nice” while they routinely cruel condescending mocking and hateful towards people who don’t share their ideological worldview. 
The fact that they’re also cruel to victims of Child Sex Abuse who don’t happen to be politically “worthy” of McRae & co’s selective empathy should also tell you a lot.
Those who defend Ideological Secularism while condemning Christians for their much smaller sex abuse problem are more than hypocrites. They’re hatemongers, period. We sex abuse survivors are overwhelmingly more likely to be abused by Secular authorities than religious ones. So when Anti-Religious zealots feel entitled to morally condemn everyone else, the rest of us have no obligation to listen or care. 
These are people who will never subject themselves, or people or things they like, to the same standards they apply to all religious people.
And they’re also, it bears repeating, people who will routinely tell you that morality is entirely subjective or a social construct.
In short, being called Morally Bankrupt by people who have no morals is not particularly upsetting.

 
PS: This is an open offer to anyone in McRae’s orbit who is taking this guy seriously to come onto a stream and talk to us. We offered McRae friendship and dialogue and discussions on how to make Atheist-Theist relations better and how to do scientific debates in an interesting and truly useful way, but no dice. Still, we’re happy to talk to anyone who was on this stream, or listening to it, who wants OUR perspective.

Exorcists work with Psychiastrists, Psychologists, and other medical professionals rather regularly. Yet some insist that there’s no such thing as the demonic, despite the evidence that it’s real. What do you think?

Title: Orthodox Religion is the Antidote to Feminism
Author: Rob Scovell

Category: Uncategorized

Entry: 
My journey to Eastern Orthodoxy has run in parallel with my fight against Feminism.
My fight against Feminism is not about a fight against the natural civil rights of women to be equal under the law but a fight against the suppression of masculinity in our culture.
Masculinity brings order and structure to our social life and the more it is suppressed, the more chaotic life becomes.
We can see this in the inchoate hammering at the doors of the Supreme Court in Washington after the confirmation of Kavanaugh.
‘The Sergeant At Arms will restore order in the gallery’ will go down in history after Vice President Mike Pence repeatedly stated it during the final vote on Kavanaugh’s fate.
Anyone wishing to restore order in their life will find the power to do so in Orthodoxy.
Mainstream Western Christianity is complicit in the suppression of masculinity. The Anglican Church is stripping its liturgies of masculine language and removing the requirement of married couples to be male and female. The other mainline denominations are doing the same.
Western Christianity, by being Western, is in the same muddied pool as the rest of Western culture.
The Orthodox Church is a hospital for the spiritually sick … and we are all spiritually sick.
The Orthodox Church of Antioch has a specific mission to Westerners looking to reconnect with original Christianity. My road to Orthodoxy took me to the Antiochian Church but there are other Orthodox traditions that remain in accordance with the Scriptures.
Oriental Orthodox churches such as the Armenian and Coptic churches are also places where you will find a tradition that continues in accordance with the scriptures.
If you are outside Christianity, of course I would say to you that Christ is the fulfilment of your tradition, but if you haven’t come to that point, I suggest going back to the orthodox forms of your own religion. Orthodox Judaism remains true to the Torah. Theravada Buddhism, unlike the California style of Buddhism, is true to the original scriptures of the Buddha and is in harmony with the moral structure of the universe. Taoism is certainly an antidote to Feminism in the way it balances male and female. Traditionalist movements in the Roman Church are a particularly powerful development in this regard and I would encourage Roman Catholics to support these movements.
If you are looking for the antidote to Feminism, Orthodoxy is where you will find it.

Chapter 1 – Set for Life at a Cost
Growing up is a process that could take one’s entire life. There’s a certain fear of it especially when it comes to financial concerns. It’s one of the main reasons why people get jobs after all. There is probably not one person in the world who hasn’t wished for a solution to all of their problems to appear to them in a single day. Jorge is a boy who is lucky enough to have a one-million-dollar bill fly straight to him. He then sees another and catches it. Then another then another and another until he has ten million dollars in his hands. Jorge is old enough to know what he can do with all of this money and that he is set for life with it. He runs to find the source of the money and comes across a band of thieves in a gunfight with the cops.
Gunfights in the streets of Hillside City are common since the city is one of the craziest in the world. The cops are trained to know when to shoot first and ask questions later and this is one of those situations. The reason why money is flying through the air appears to be because the case of money the thieves were stealing was shot open by the cops. The thieves are struggling to pick up what they can while retreating. One of them notices Jorge holding some of the money and runs after him.
Jorge runs into the nearby alleyways, which he and his friends repurposed into an obstacle course. It was dangerous work that they could’ve gotten into trouble for, but what kind of adventure doesn’t involve danger. Jorge leaps and crawls through the obstacle course while the thief struggles to keep up with him since the obstacle course was made for kids. The thief then gets caught in the obstacle course and gives up on chasing Jorge this way. Jorge takes the opportunity to quickly head home. Along the way, he periodically looks behind him as he’s anxious. He has the key to an easy life in his hands. He won’t need to worry anymore about going to school, college, or having enough money to survive once he gets this money back home.
Looking back behind him, he can see shadows quickly darting back into the shadows. People who aren’t looking at him appear to grow another face on their face that stares at Jorge when he looks at them. He knows this is more than his imagination. It’s Speculum Humanae or Human mirror, a condition that people have that’s reported to appear in them once they reach a certain point in their lives when everything changes. Jorge doesn’t want to believe he has this, but all the research papers and news reports he’s read point him towards this conclusion. Monsters and other supernatural happenings reflective of your personality are reported to haunt you until you get past this important moment in your life. Jorge hopes that him heading home will “cure” him of this condition before something dangerous happens to him.
Before he knows it, he’s back home and catches his parents leaving for work. He’s relieved to see them, but they’re less so.
“Jorge, what are you doing here?” his father yells.
Before he has the chance to say anything or pull out the money, his mother says, “It’s his lunch time. You know how these kids like heading home to get away from school. We used to go to a cool breakfast place around here, remember?”
“Oh, that’s right. I’m sorry Jorge.”
His mother goes up to him and hands him a twenty for lunch before kissing him on the head and going into their car. His parents then waved goodbye and tell him that they love him as they drive off to work. Jorge waves the money to them, but they’re too far to see it so they just wave back. Even though Jorge has a copy of the key to get inside the house, he left it inside the house because he usually heads home when his parents get back.
Now that his parents have left, Jorge feels unsafe. He can feel people staring at him from all around him. The only thing he can do is head back to school where he can possibly be protected. Since he’s out on the streets, Jorge goes through a series of alleyways to get to school. He feels that the walls around him might offer him protection. It’s then a strange sensation in the back of his head. It feels as if there’s a mouth in the back of his head. Jorge looks into a nearby broken mirror and sure enough, there is.
It speaks to him, “Hello there Jorge.”
Jorge screams as he fiddles with his head to try to get the mouth off.
“I know it’s weird to see a mouth on the back of your head but look at it this way. Would you rather be me, a mouth without a body, or you a boy with a full body?”
Jorge stays quiet and thinks the answer to himself.
“Exactly. Now the reason why I’m here, is because I’m going to help you as you go through this phase in your life. I’ll be telling you what you’re thinking and what we could possibly do, but you’re the one who has to decide. Got it?”
Jorge nods his head.
“Good! You and I are going to have so many adventures together, I can’t wait.”
The mouth then recedes back into Jorge’s head. Jorge thinks things have gotten worse for him. He quickens his pace until he’s back at school just in time as lunchtime has stopped. He quickly heads back to class and sits down in his seat. Class begins again, but Jorge wants to tell his friends what he got. The two of them sit ahead of Jorge and the people ahead of Jorge aren’t exactly friends with him so it’s not like they’ll do him a favor by passing his message to them, so he waits until school ends for the day.
Once the school day ends Jorge takes his stuff and goes to his talk to his friends, he almost catches up to him until the mouth on his head comes back.
“Watch it, kid, we got trouble,” it says as Jorge’s eyes catch the four of the thieves from before heading this way.
They point towards the school as they talk to each other. It seems that the one who was following Jorge managed to follow him to the school. The thought then comes to Jorge’s mind that the one thief also now knows where he lives. This terrifies him beyond belief. The cops, thankfully, find the thieves again and re-engage them in a gunfight. The children of the school scatter to the cars of their parents while others run back home. Jorge runs with his friends back to their house. The thieves catch sight of Jorge running away and send two of their members to get him. They chase after Jorge and his friends as they run through the city streets and into the alleyways that they’ve claimed for themselves. Again, because of their design, Jorge is able to get away from the robbers through the alleyways, however, Jorge’s friends are caught at the end of one alleyway causing him to take another exit.
“That wasn’t nice of you,” the mouth on his head says, “Leaving your friends to criminals like them?”
Jorge shakes off the guilt in his mind. It’s not like his friends won’t tell the thieves what they don’t already know, but then again, you never know what these criminals might do to his friends. Hillside City is home to some of the most dangerous and crazy people. The alleyways that Jorge once knew by heart have now turned into a maze. Arms, eyes, and mouths pop out from the sides. Some of them push him forward while others push him back while telling him to take either action.
“What are you going to choose, Jorge? Hmmm?”
When Jorge looks back, he can see two thieves chasing me, but they’re different. Their mouths are swollen and monstrous and their arms look like they could rip Jorge in two.
“Get me out of here!” Jorge screams.
“It shall be done.”
At the blink of an eye, Jorge remerges from an alleyway on the opposite side of the city. It’s way later in the day now and it’s almost nighttime. Jorge sighs in relief as he makes his way back home. Along the way, he hears two people talking.
“Did you hear about those thieves that stole a briefcase of money from a rich guy in the city? The cops shot the briefcase so the thieves’ priorities would be spilt, and all that money flew into the wind.”
“Really? I wish I was there to catch some.”
“I heard that some people did catch some of it, but as you can expect, they ran off with it before being asked to give it back.”
“What happened to the thieves?”
“Executed. Hillside City style.”
“That’s what you get when you have a mayor that was previously both a police chief and a crime boss.”
“Hey, he had a good reason for being a “criminal”. It’s not like he hurt anyone who didn’t deserve it.”
“Right. It’s just another day in the city then.”
“Yeah, but I heard at least four or more people died because they might’ve had the money that flew away.”
“Really? Who?”
“A bunch of middle-aged people and more importantly, kids.”
“You know what? I take back what I said. Let the major make the police do what he wants. Crime has gone down because of it and those dead criminals don’t breathe the same air as us anymore.”
Jorge’s heart sinks as he pulls out his phone to see the news report. Among the names of the victims, he finds the names of his friends and his parents. It is reported they died after being questioned by the thieves.
The mouth in the back of Jorge’s head says, “Welcome to your new life kid. Hey, don’t be sad. At least you have enough money to survive until you die, right?”
Jorge walks into the alleyway and quietly sobs as the long night begins.
 
 

Chapter 2 – Living with Everything and Nothing
“What am I going to do now? I have all of this money but what am I going to spend it on? Can I even deposit the money into a bank account? I don’t have one and I could one, but the bankers would be suspicious of me. The news of people taking the stolen money is still fresh news so they might report me to the police if I give them even a one-million-dollar bill. I could go to Hillfall Town or some other place where the news hasn’t reached yet. But still, a kid like me going into a bank will tons of money would be weird. I could go to jail for life for having this money on me!”
“I guess all that money in your pocket isn’t as valuable as you think, don’t you think? Wouldn’t it be easier to just throw it all away?”
Jorge thinks about it for a second then decides against it.
“All I have to do is find a way to use this money and then I’ll be set for life. I could make it up to my parents and friends by using it for good!”
“But it can’t bring them back to life.”
“I won’t need to, to make them proud of me.”
“Is that what you really think?”
Jorge doesn’t answer the mouth and gets up. The main idea in his head right now is to get to Hillfall Town to deposit his money into a bank account. He’s just old enough to have a bank account but he still needs a guardian that will have to share a joint account with him. Jorge is sure that he can get someone to share his money with him especially if he finds a nice family who will accept him. Not too long ago, a popular author lost his wife and has now lost his daughter. Jorge thinks to himself that he can bring this money to him and be adopted into this author’s family relatively easily, but that’s only one of the thoughts in his head so far.
“Maybe there’s even a poor family in the city that could use the money I have. Yeah, this’ll definitely help them out.”
“You’re such a hero, aren’t you?”
Jorge chuckles while ignoring the mouth’s sarcastic remark. There are much more important things to think about to him. So many more important things to look forward to. He’s on the edge of living an easy life and now it only takes the permission of one adult to get it. With all of this pressure on him, Jorge can feel the stares of everyone, everything, and the nothing around him. Eyes feel like they’re peering at him from all angles as if they’re waiting for him to let go of the money in his pocket. A single slip of the hand could cause them to lunge out from the shadows and take Jorge’s easy pass, so he’s holding tight to it as if his existence depended on it.
“Aren’t you forgetting something, Jorge?”
“No, I don’t think so.”
“Your parents Jorge and your friends. What about them? You just cried about them minutes ago and now you’re completely fine.”
“I’m still sad about them.”
“It doesn’t look like it. You didn’t even think about visiting their houses to pay your respects. You have ten million dollars on you. I’m sure you can give them at least one of those to them as a way of saying sorry for getting them killed. Or wait, is that why you don’t want to see them?”
“That’s not it.”
“Why aren’t you doing anything about it then?”
“There’s nothing I can do that’s going to make it up to them! This money isn’t going to help them feel better!”
“It’s helping you, isn’t it? Maybe it isn’t?”
“Shut up. I’ll just wait for a while to talk to them.”
“Are you sure? I’m sure they’re worried about you too. Are you really going to let your guilt get to you like this?”
“I’m done talking to you.”
“I’m sure you are.”
He hasn’t noticed, but Jorge has walked into a graveyard.
“How did we get here?”
“You weren’t paying attention to where we were going. You don’t even know where you’re going.”
The wind seems to whisper to Jorge. It’s a quiet whisper that whispers Jorge’s guilts to him. It unnerves him to the point where he starts scratching the inside of his ears.
“You heard what they said. What are you going to do about it?”
The unnerving feeling in his ears spreads to the rest of his body until mouths start growing in his ears, on his body, and in it. They keep whispering the words of the wind. Jorge tries to pull off the mouths off his skin but can’t manage to. He rolls around on the ground desperately trying to quiet the whispers until he wakes up inside his room. For some reason, he’s back inside his house.
Jorge looks around and it appears that everything he remembers was just a dream. He no longer has ten million dollars in his pockets. He doesn’t even have the twenty his mom gave him. It’s like today never happened. Jorge smiles as he feels relieved. Everything was a dream and how could it not be with how crazy things were. To make sure he’s truly awake, he quietly walks into his parent’s room to find them sleeping peacefully. He breathes another sigh of relief, but then his eyes catch something strange in the dark. Jorge sees blood dripping from the bed. Panicking, he goes to wake up his parents.
He shakes their shoulder’s while saying, “Mom? Dad?”
They don’t respond and don’t even seem to be breathing anymore.
“Mom?! Dad?!”
Again, they don’t respond. Jorge rips the sheets off his parents to find that only their heads are on the bed that is now crimson red.
“No…”
In denial at what he’s seeing, Jorge runs out of the room and wakes up in his classroom. The bell rings for lunchtime and all of the students get up to get their lunches. Jorge no longer knows what to think and intuitively leaves the school to get lunch at a place that his parents used to go. Along the way he sees money flying through the air, he catches as much money as he can until he has ten million dollars in his hand. He then thinks to himself about what he should do. After a bit of thinking and hearing the gunfire in the distance, he walks away with the money and doesn’t go to get more, however, a thief that’s chasing the flying money sees him and chases him. The same things happen up to the point where Jorge and his friends are running away in the alleyway.
When he is again presented with the choice to save his friends or to run the other way, he again runs the other way. Instead of running into a continuous alley, Jorge runs into a dead end with an open mouth at the end that speaks of Jorge’s guilts.
“You’re going to have to run into it kid if you want to survive.”
Jorge is hesitant, but he runs through the mouth and ends up back where he was in Hillside City and walking towards to some kind of destination.
“What was that? I don’t understand anything that’s happening to me! Why?”
“You saw why. You barely changed your decisions when you went through them again in your head. You might feel guilty for what you did, but you sure aren’t going to change the reason why you got that guilt. That’s for sure.”
“No! That’s not it, I do feel guilty! I am sorry for what I did!”
Wanting to prove himself, Jorge takes five million dollars out of his pocket and throws it into the air, but once the money files out, it appears back in his pockets. He keeps trying to get rid of the money to no avail as it keeps appearing in his pockets.
“Jorge, Jorge! You feel guilty, but you don’t want to get rid of the money. It’d be one thing if you felt like you didn’t want to get rid of it but wanted to, that’s understandable, however, you are the opposite. You feel like you want to get rid of it, but alas, you don’t want to. You want to be rid of the guilt not the reason for it.”
Jorge breathes as if he were running on a treadmill and puts his hands on his knees as he thinks about what he should do. He then goes back to his original plan.
“I want to have a reason to get rid of this.”
“It’s more like you want a good reason that sounds good to you, but sure. Let’s go find a reason.”
He walks off while still gripping the cash in his pockets that also appear to have their thorns in his hand.
 
 
 
 

Chapter 3 – Not your Typical Angel
As Jorge makes it way to whatever destination he’s thinking of, he comes across a church. He sees that the lights are still open inside. The thought comes to him that he should go inside and confess his sins or seek help from a priest, but he’s not sure if his sins are forgivable so he walks away. A noise draws his eyes to the cross on top of the cathedral. He sees a monster that’s almost indescribable. It appears to be a reaper with a single eye and a long mouth that can split. The monster has four arms in the center of its body and one long arm with an ax and another with a noose. All of its body is cloaked in a black robe and it has two wings that are half clipped with feathers falling off it.
“What is that thing?!” Jorge asks as he slowly backs away.
The monster focuses its eye on Jorge as two hands pray, two other hands are lifted into the air and the ax and noose are lifted into the air.
“You’ve heard of your guardian angel before. Now, behold the Divine Executioner as he cleanses the wicked.”
The executioner screams out as everything, but the church is affected by its screams. It flies down to attack Jorge as he runs away. Jorge moves out of the way of the fast strikes delivered by the heavy ax. He runs into an alleyway thinking that the monster can’t fit into it. The executioner flies over him as it chases him. Trash and other objects in the alleyway start forming themselves into obstacles like the ones Jorge and his friends made. The obstacles form as Jorge approaches him which forces him to quickly react to them. Adding to the danger, the executioner lowers its noose every now and then to try to catch Jorge in it. Fortunately, he manages to get through them, but he gets a few scratches from the sharp objects in the alley.
Unnerving laughter comes from the executioner as it flies down and manages to fit in the alley. The executioner only appears large because of the cloak over its skinny body. It raises its ax in preparation to attack.
“Watch it, kid. The alleyway splits off ahead. One way leads to a mouth that will lead you far away from the execution, but is the least dangerous, while the other is more dangerous, but doesn’t get you too far away from it.”
Seeing as the approaching executioner forces Jorge to choose the least difficult route. He goes through an obstacle course that only has one way to get around it.
“I thought you said this was the least difficult!”
“But I didn’t say that it wasn’t difficult.”
Jorge manages to get through the obstacle course and run through the mouth, but the executioner’s ax manages to slice through Jorge’s bag as if it wasn’t there and cut Jorge’s back. He reels in pain as he tries to keep moving. The mouth has teleported him back to where he left his friends. He goes back to where he left them and sees blood on the ground. It appears that a crime scene was set up here and the bodies have recently been taken away by the authorities.
“Why am here? Haven’t I seen this enough already?”
“Apparently not. I shouldn’t bother you though, right? You’re a big boy now who’s made this important decision not only once but twice.”
Not wanting to deal with this again, Jorge turns away and starts walking again. Suddenly, he hears the laughter and flapping wings of the executioner in the distance. Jorge turns around to see it approaching at a fast rate.
“I thought you said I would be far away from this thing!”
“But I never said you would get away.”
Jorge can’t run so he tries to hide. There’s an abandoned house not too far from the school that his friends used to explore. He finds his way into the house through the basement window and hides in the darkest corner of the basement.
“What’s the plan, Jorge?”
“I’m going to hide here for now.”
“Do you really think that’s going to help? It doesn’t track you by sight you know. You staying here will only give you a few moments of safety.”
As Jorge begins to think about what to do, he hears the executioner land outside. The sound of its robe can be heard gliding across the grass then across the floor upstairs. It phases through doors and through walls and floors to find Jorge.
“It knows where you are. It’s just playing with you to see if you’ll come out to face it.”
“That’s what I’ll do.”
“That’s the spirit, boy.”
Jorge recalls an old rifle in the bedroom that he and his friends found. They fired it once not too long ago and found out that it still works. Thankfully, no one got hurt that day, but right now, Jorge needs it to. Jorge exits the basement through the window then quietly walks up the stairs, which attracts the attention of the executioner. It chases Jorge as he runs into the bedroom with the rifle. He dodges its ax swings as he tries to find it. When he does, he shoots its eye, which makes it scream in pain. The recoil makes Jorge drop the gun. He scrambles to pick it up until the executioner uppercuts him with its ax, which makes Jorge fly out the window and into a giant gaping mouth outside. It transports him back to where he was outside the church. He’s still staring at the cross on top of the holy building.
A priest notices Jorge blankly staring outside, walks outside, and asks, “Are you okay, my son?”
Jorge then focuses on the priest whose entire face is now a mouth who constantly says, “Confess, confess, confess.”
People start gathering around Jorge say things like, “Confess.”
“Give it up.”
“Selfish child.”
“Uncaring friend.”
“Dishonest boy.”
“Confess.”
Their voices spin Jorge’s head around and around until his left arm falls off then the other. After, his head falls off, and the crowds gather around him and pick up his head and put his head and arms back on his body. They are silent as this happens.
Once Jorge is whole again, his friends and family whisper into his ear, “Confess.”
Again, Jorge is staring blankly at the cross on top of the church.
A priest notices Jorge blankly staring outside, walks outside, and asks, “Are you okay, my son?”
He snaps out of it this time and says, “Y-yes, father.”
“Okay, but you don’t seem to be. Isn’t it a bit late for you to be out by yourself? Do you want me to call your parents to pick you up?”
“Oh, no. I’m fine. I was just heading home.”
“Alright. Good night and bless you.”
Jorge nods his head and walks away from the church.
“Was that really the smart decision to make, Jorge?” the mouth on his head asks.
“No, probably not, but there’s always another way.”
“But you might not get to it. The priest is walking back into the church. It might be embarrassing, but at least your problem will be resolved.”
“…”
“Or is that not the way you want it to be resolved?”
“I…uh.”
“Oh, keep walking if you want, but know that it will get worse if you do.”
Jorge can’t help but keep walking in his directionless quest. It’s too easy for him to keep walking with his aching legs but it’s hard for him to stop and turn around.
“So be it then according to your will.”
 
 

Chapter 4 – Wanted by Some, Loved by None
Despite everything that’s happened to him, Jorge remains somewhat unshaken by his decision. All remains quiet for a while as he walks the streets. There aren’t many people out at this hour besides the police, and criminals that live in the shadows. Jorge’s mind makes him feel that people are staring at him in the dark. This makes him walk uneasy and with caution until he sees a woman on the corner. She’s scantily dressed, and Jorge is old enough to know what she is.
“Maybe I can get her out of this life if I offer her the money,” Jorge thinks to himself.
“Maybe or maybe you could make it worse.”
“Tch.”
Ignoring the mouth on his head’s advice, he walks up to the woman.
She curiously looks at him and asks, “Is there something you need, kid?”
“Yeah, I can get you out of this job if you take me in.”
Jorge lifts the millions of dollars in his pockets just enough so that she can see it. Her eyes widen, and she smiles a bit.
“Well, aren’t you the sweetest thing in the world. I might even just marry you right now if you asked me.”
“Uh…you’re welcome.”
“Aww. So shy.”
The woman kisses Jorge’s lips, which makes his face turn red. He rubs off the kiss as the woman giggles.
“What’s your name, kid? My name is Candice.”
“Jorge.”
“That’s a nice name. Let’s go to my or should I say our home.”
“Okay.”
Candice takes Jorge by his hand and he passively allows it. They walk a short distance and enter an unclean looking apartment. Jorge can smell the potent smell of Hillside City depravity in the air around him. Despite holding hands with a stranger, he’d rather have someone near him than no one. Candice unlocks her door and leads Jorge into her apartment room. It’s a mess like the rest of the apartment building, but at least he won’t have to live in it for too long. A young girl walks out of her room in her PJs that look more like would fit in her mom’s closet. She appears to be a little younger than Jorge.
“Natty honey, we have a new man in the family,” Candice says while hugging Jorge from behind.
Natty looks at Jorge funny as he blushes again and tries to keep eye contact. “H-hi Natty. I’m Jorge.”
“This boy, who would be perfect as your husband just saying, has the money we need to live easy lives.”
“Really?” Natty asks with a glimmer of hope sparkly in her eye.
“That’s right. Make him feel welcome while I run a few errands.”
Candice hits Jorge in the butt and winks at him before leaving. Natty leads Jorge to her room then closes the door behind him.
“Nice, Jorge. I’m jealous,” the mouth on the back of his head says.
“So uh, Natty. You got a nice mom.”
“Not really. How much money do you have on you?”
“Uh. Ten million and twenty dollars.”
“Oh wow! No wonder she wants you here. Hey, how did you get all that money? You weren’t at the robbery today, were you?”
“I was actually. I caught all this money.”
“Dang it.”
“What is it?”
Natty opens the door and eavesdrops on her mother who is talking on the phone outside the room. She puts her finger on her mouth to tell Jorge to be quiet. Once her mother is done talking, Natty hurries Jorge back to her room.
“What’s happening?”
“My mom knows people who ordered those robbers to steal that money you have. They might kill you and take the money you have for themselves.”
“How do you know?”
“Because that’s what we usually do with whoever we bring in.”
Jorge gulps. Only he can hear the mouth on his head laugh. “You really hit the jackpot now didn’t ya Jorge?”
“What should I do?”
“We have to see. I’m not sure what mom is going to do.”
The kids can hear a man enter the room.
“Oh no. He’s here.”
“Who is?”
“It doesn’t matter, just hide!”
Natty moves Jorge behind her closet which leads to a hidden escape staircase.
“Wait here for a second.”
Natty moves the closet over the escape route. It sounds like from Jorge’s side that’s she’s opening a window to make it look like he escaped through it. The two adults sound like they enter the room and ask Natty about what happened to Jorge. She tells him her answer and it appears that the man is upset. Candice sounds worried as well, but then it sounds like someone gets pushed up against a wall. Jorge can then hear what sounds like someone biting into bone. Screaming is heard for a while which includes the screams of Natty who sounds like she’s telling Jorge to run, though it sounds like she’s screaming outside the window. Another bone biting sound is heard along with screaming.
More afraid than ever, Jorge runs down the escape stairs while trying to make as less noise as possible. He escapes out a small door in an alleyway. He starts to run but is then stopped by the shadow of a man in the distance. Jorge hides in the shadows as he observes the man. The man is standing in the streets and appears to be wearing a mask of some sorts. The underneath of his mask appears to be oozing blood. He looks around and hastily walks as it appears that he’s the one who’s looking for Jorge. There’s an urban legend about a man who’s known to eat the necks of people in Hillside City. He would offer you your heart’s desire and after you enjoy it, he would eat your neck as payment.
“Come on, Jorge. You have to move. You can’t be frozen in fear. It’s too warm for that,” the mouth on his head says as it urges him forward.
Jorge cautiously walks forward. He peaks out of the alleyway and starts walking when it looks like no one is around.
Someone behind Jorge, says from the shadows, “There he is! Get him!”
Multiple shadow people come out from the darkness and begin to chase Jorge. He runs away and keeps running until he reaches another alleyway, in which he can lose them in and since they’ve always been his escape. A woman who looks similar to Candice catches him.
She looks at him with a smile and says, “Calm down, boy. I’ll keep you safe.”
The woman kisses Jorge as she uses one arm to hold him and the other to take the money in his pockets. He breaks away from her and knees her in her crotch in response. Jorge tries to run away but is caught by another older woman who does the same, but she bites his neck right after. Another woman comes by and bites into the other side of Jorge’s neck and more come to feel his pockets for his money.
“Just take it and leave me alone!” Jorge screams.
A familiar scream is heard as the Divine Executioner comes down from the sky and lands on the ground. The women scatter as the executioner defends Jorge. They try to get around the angel, but they are flattened by its large ax. Jorge, who is still scared out of his mind, runs away further into the alleyway. The executioner chases him as it defends him while trying to catch him. There’s a mouth at the end of this alley. Jorge runs through it and ends up near the edge of Hillside City.
Now that he’s away from the action, he sits at a nearby park bench in front of the famous hills of the city.
“You tried helping people and they ended up getting killed, Jorge. What are you going to do now?”
Jorge reaches into his pocket and he can feel the blood on the money he has. He pulls it out and looks at it. The money is now biting his skin and making him bleed, so he takes all of it out and releases it out into the air.
“Atta boy.”
“What do I do now?”
“The choice is up to you, but at least you’re better off now than before.”
“I hope so.”
Jorge gets up then resumes walking to whatever destination and fate await him.
 
 
 

Chapter 5 – Confession then Absolution
Now more directionless than ever, Jorge walks the streets of Hillside City waiting for something to happen. There is something urging him to go forward in a certain direction. A light that he can barely see ahead of him that’s bright enough for only the soul to notice. The screams of the executioner announce its approach and Jorge is not as afraid to face it this time. It lands in front of him and raises its ax with all four of its hands in a praying position. With nothing left to his life, Jorge closes his eyes and allows the executioner to strike him. Once it does, another body of Jorge’s falls to the ground behind him as the ax phases through him. The old Jorge burns into ashes as the new one lives on.
The Divine Executioner now looks more like an actual angel with its wings back and a more human look to it. It bows before Jorge and he bows in return.
The mouth on Jorge’s head says, “You know, people see angels as devils when they try to tear away their possessions that are causing their souls to decay. They’re trying to free your soul from the vices that lead you to ruin. Thankfully, you were able to be freed.”
“What’s going to happen now? Why do I still see you and the executioner?”
“You’re going to need our help with something that’s coming up.”
“What? When? Or is that a dumb question?”
“Actually, you’re going to need our help right now. Look behind you.”
A group of people is running towards Jorge. They appear to be the same people who were trying to take the ten million dollars off of him. They’re smug since he doesn’t move from where he is. Right now, they can’t see the executioner, but they do once it strikes the ground. They all look up to it and scream in terror. They call the angel a devil, a demon, and a monster as they try to uselessly fight against it. The executioner hangs several people and mercilessly hits them with its ax. They can’t take the sight of their previous body nor can they stand losing the vices that give them so much joy. The ruckus gets the attention of the cops that were looking for these criminals.
A group of officers arrive to find a bunch of people gone mad scraping the ground while Jorge stands above them and is trying to walk around them. The police arrest the many criminals and bring in Jorge who says that his parents were killed, and he needed a place to go. The families of his friends actually called the police after the shooting and are coming to the police station to see Jorge. While he is waiting, Jorge admits to the police that he was one of the people who caught the million dollars that were flying in the air. The chief of police, Harley, talks to him personally in her office.
She asks, “Do you still have the money with you?”
“N-no, I let go of it because having it got my family and friends killed.”
“I don’t know why you had to confess then. Do you still feel guilty?”
“I do.”
“Well, you shouldn’t. You did something that not many people would do.”
“Are you going to arrest me?”
“I don’t see a reason too. That money you had was blood money anyhow held by a person we didn’t exactly like so I’ll give you a pass.”
“Really?”
“Of course.”
“Thank you so much.”
“What do you want to be when you grow up?”
“I uh. I don’t really know yet.”
“That’s fine. Not many kids do at your age. Maybe you should be a police officer when you grow up. We could use officers who can make hard decisions like you do.”
“I’ll think about it.”
“Just keep it in mind. We have a lot of women in the force who like men like you. How did you get in that situation with all those criminals at your feet?”
“It’s complicated to explain.”
“Then make it as simple as possible.”
“It involves the Divine Executioner that hit them with an ax that killed a part of them and there was a mouth on the back of my head that liked to talk a lot and-”
“Okay, stop. Make it less complicated.”
“I don’t know how to.”
“It’s fine. I understand what you went through.”
The families of Jorge’s friends knock on Harley’s door.
“Come in.”
The families tell Jorge how thankful they are that he’s alive, but he shakes their hearts when he admits that he was the reason why their children died. They don’t know what to say so they awkwardly tell him again that they’re thankful he’s alive before leaving the room and the police station. The only family that Jorge thought who might’ve accepted him has just left him alone.
Harley puts her hand on Jorge’s shoulder, and says, “I’m sorry Jorge.”
“It’s okay. I forgive them.”
A man enters the room without knocking.
Harley turns around. “Leo, so you decided to show up.”
“That’s right, Harley. I had to see this remarkable young man.”
Leo holds out his hand with a smile and says, “Nice to meet you, Jorge. Do you know who I am?”
Jorge hastily shakes Leo’s hand and says, “Yes, Mr. Mayor.”
“Just call me Leo.”
“Okay, Leo.”
“Harley told me what you did, and it seems like you don’t have anywhere to go.”
“The families of his friends just left.”
“They did? Idiots. Those people don’t see the potential in you. Why don’t you come with me and live with me at my place? I could help you become a great man.”
Jorge thinks about it then says, “I’ll do that, but you have to promise me that you won’t give me money that I didn’t earn. I want to earn everything I get no matter how small it is.”
“I promise. You’ve actually started becoming a great man with that mindset. You’ll accomplish great things if you keep thinking this way and growing in it.”
“I will?”
“Yes, you’ll see.”

Title: The Tyranny of Feminism
Author: Rob Scovell
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/10/09/the-tyranny-of-feminism/
Category: Men's rights
Date: October 9, 2018
Entry: 
Feminism was pretty much unheard of in our family. We had other problems: looking after my aging grandmother and dealing with the various crises of my cousins took all our familial energy. I worked hard at school and spent my spare time doing typical boy stuff: building radios and model aeroplanes, messing around with computers and electronics, and hanging out with a retired wartime engineer who was something of a father figure and mentor for me.

I went to and old-school boys’ school where we sang the old-school Anglican hymns such as Fight the Good Fight.
I worked in various paid jobs while I was a high school and A-Level student, because I needed the money. We were not rich and in the intricate structure of the English class system, we were somewhere between lower middle class and upper working class. The women I worked with were ‘normal’ and nobody talked about feminism.
When I went to University, I was quite naive and rather uncultured. I was thrown into a middle class, moneyed environment and I felt out of place, but being Edinburgh, I had a lot of opportunities to soak up the best of Western culture: opera; symphonies; a very wide denominational range of churches etc. Edinburgh was where I met Christ too. That city has a huge place in my heart and it seems I return in my dreams almost every night.
Growing up, I had witnessed a lot of sexual chaos in my wider family, and I wanted to avoid it. I decided early on that I wouldn’t go out with girls I didn’t feel I could potentially marry. I was serious-minded about that: I didn’t want to waste my time on random flings and deal with all the emotional chaos I saw around me.
My first relationship was with Louise. We had been really good friends for a year before we started ‘going out’ because even though it was obvious to all that we had mutual feelings, I was scared of getting too involved.
When we went from friends to ‘an item’, the dynamic between us changed. Instead of being equals, suddenly, I found myself expected to be subservient to her wishes. I overheard her talking to a flat-mate about getting me ‘under the thumb’. When I visited her family, I saw how sad her father was and how dominant her mother was. He spent more time with his classic car that with his wife, and I could see why. Louise told me he was ‘under the thumb’.
I didn’t want to become sad and subservient so I ended the relationship.
The next girl I fell in love with was Susan. Susan was a Feminist. She, too, wanted to dominate. Who wants to live a life dominated by another person? I saw the signs early and ended that relationship too before I got in too deep.
I wondered if I had a problem with women?
But when I talked about it with my closest friends, we all agreed that these two girls were treating the relationship like a power struggle.
That is what Feminism is: a power struggle that men must not be allowed to win. On the surface, it is about ‘equality’. In reality, it is about dominance.
I became aware of the huge number of sad, dominated men, following their bright, lively wives around. That was not the life I wanted for myself.
I eventually married Liz: I will draw a veil over that failed marriage as to speak about it is potentially hurtful to my children, and I do not like to wash my dirty linen in public.
It wasn’t until I met Polly, a traditional Theravada Buddhist from Thailand, that I experienced a relationship with the kind of strong woman I am attracted to that wasn’t a power struggle, because her strength is oriented towards her family.
Back in my Edinburgh days, I attended an Anglican church that had a feminist Deacon-in-Charge. She flirted with me a lot (a metoo story?) and talked a lot about non-hierarchical structures. However, non-hierarchy only went one way. She didn’t want to be accountable to anyone but she wanted the congregation to be accountable to her. There were a lot of subtle power games going on. She sought power in the Church. She seemed no different from other power-hungry clergy I had met despite her talk of ‘non-hierarchical structures’.
I have met many ardently feminist women and there are some striking patterns: she is from a privileged background; she has had a tyrannical or abusive father; she has inherited her father’s tyrannical nature but feels guilty about it and projects it; her strength is for her own selfish purpose, not for her family; she is continually angry. When she attains a position of power, she acts tyrannically, ignoring structures of accountability and hierarchies of competence, seeing every situation through her feminist, anti-male lens.
The Book of Proverbs in the Bible describes the ideal wife as a woman who is able to go out and make good business deals for her family: i.e. a strong, capable woman, who uses her strength for the sake of her family. This is an archetype that the strong independent angry egotistical feminist bent on tyranny would do well to meditate upon!

Title: Kavanaugh, the Anglican Conversation, and the Masculine
Author: Rob Scovell
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/10/08/kavanaugh-the-anglican-conversation-and-the-masculine/
Category: essays
Date: October 8, 2018
Entry: 
As I write this, we are on the eve of the final Act of the Kavanaugh Confirmation Drama.
The drama we see played out in the U.S. Senate is the same as the drama in the Anglican Church.
The motivation is the same: the desire to expunge our institutions of the last vestiges of masculinity.
Our institutions have been captured at every level by individuals with an ideological motivation to dissolve the essential categories of gender. Male and female are to be no more.
Masculinity and femininity are both under political attack but the strongest assault is on masculinity.
It must not be allowed to happen.
The Kavanaugh confirmation process must be the point at which we say Stop: No More!
The Democratic Caucus in the U.S. Senate is under the control of Leftist female-dominated leadership. The result is a clear abandonment of due process and the rule of law. The behaviour of this leadership is in danger of undermining the acceptance of female leadership: the Leftist female leadership of the Democrat Party has fallen into the age-old anti-female stereotype of the elevation of hysterical emotion over cool reason.
There is no evidence that Kavanaugh has done anything wrong. The hysteria against him is a result of the Feminist delusion that all men are rapists or potential rapists. This man is a devoted family man and a fair and kind mentor and friend to many women in his profession. He is also a man who knows his boundaries and has built an honorable boundary around his family.
The Democratic Caucus in the U.S. Senate has attempted to breach the boundary he has built. When boundaries are attacked, the result is anger. This man expressed his anger, but also expressed the Christian call to love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us. This call was expressed not in a spirit of self-righteousness but expressed through his 10-year-old daughter, who was subsequently ridiculed by a Leftist cartoonist and various Twitter trolls.
This man shows considerable personal and Christian maturity, and yet is under continual attack.
The mainstream press here in New Zealand will not publish anything in his favour, instead regurgitating hysterical opinion pieces based on completely uncorroborated rumours.
The behaviour of the worldwide press has been like a gossipy clique in a girl’s high school. It is frankly disgusting.
We are witnessing nothing less that toxic femininity: the chaotic swirling of emotion and rumour that leads to the destruction of a good person’s reputation and has no regard for the rules and structures and institutions that are in place to prevent injustice and tyranny.
We are witnessing the same in the Anglican Church. Liturgies are expunging the traditional masculine aspects of God. Female clergy are not bringing gender balance to congregations: instead, they are eliminating the Masculine. They are bringing Feminist theology into every level of the Church.
In the 17th Century, the West witnessed an hysterical animus against femininity that resulted in witch trials and burnings. Witches were not able to prove their innocence: they were guilty until proven innocent, but had no way to prove their innocence. The hysterical animus against masculinity we see now on the Left is the same. In there eyes, there is no way for someone such as Kavanaugh to prove his innocence. In fact, there is no innocence in masculinity, according to their dogma. ‘Believe Women’ is their creed.
We need to say Stop! No more! Here we stand! We will not have our masculine essence eliminated!

Prologue – Carriage Ride to the Unknown
“Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.” Luke 23:24
What lengths would you go to in order to do good? My name is Ashton and I am on a mission to find the City of Sanguine, a city said to have the blood of Jesus Christ Himself and used it to cure any and all diseases and injuries. This city was the talk of the world for a good part of a month before suddenly disappearing along with those who sought after the city. People thought that the city is just a rumor made to make men wander the world until they died or that it was just a false rumor made to give people false hope and pull a little prank on them. Whether a rumor or not, the people who left to find the city have disappeared without a trace which brings in talk of the paranormal. My curiosity seems to have gotten the best of me as I have accepted a stranger’s proposal to go to the city. I met him after I was talking about the city with a few friends after church. He said that he knew how to get to the city and that he would drive me there for free. I don’t know why I accepted this. Again, my curiosity seems to be the cause.
In case this is a bad situation, I take a pistol with me, which is a family heirloom. Strangely enough, while waiting for the man, I talk to a priest I know that tells me that he doesn’t see the man I met even after I described the man to him in detail. The unknown man arrives with his carriage at the front of the church and beckons me to go. The priest tells me to be careful and I tell him not to worry and tell him about my secret weapon. I get on the carriage with my luggage and ride off to the City of Sanguine or at least I hope I am. We go down a few roads that I am familiar with, but we take another few turns off the road into a forest. Once I start to worry about the path we are taking, we exit the forest and I see a city on an island in the distance.
“Is that the City of Sanguine?” I ask the man.
“It is! Doesn’t it look grand from here?”
“It does.”
The way the setting sun shines against the wonderful current Victorian architecture gives the city a grand feeling to it. As we approach the bridge that connects here to the city gates, we stop.
“What’s the matter?” I ask.
“I have a gift to give you before you enter the city. Come out so I can properly show you it.”
I get out of the carriage and the man brings a long scythe out of a box from the back of the carriage.
“You’ll need this. It’ll be of better use to you than a pistol.”
Does he know of my concealed weapon?
He continues by saying, “Now watch your fingers when you use this function for it.”
The man squeezes a small lever in the middle of the weapon and it becomes an ax spear with two ax head on both sides.
“What possible use would I need for this elaborate weapon?”
“It is just a gift from a stranger. You’ll never know when a gift such as this will be of use, however, what you gift I give you that you will use is this.  Let beasts be beasts and men be men. Do not give into temptation. You are a faithful son of God and one of His many instruments on earth.”
“That sounds like very sound advice. I will use it when the situation comes.”
“I will hope so. Now get back into the carriage. I’ll drive you across the bridge.”
We drive across the long bridge and to the gate which opens as we approach it. The carriage stops, and the gates close behind us. I step outside the carriage and the city appears to be empty.
“Excuse me, driver, where might I find someone-”
I turn to see that the driver is gone and the horses that we guided us here are statues. The carriage itself feels more like an antique model that you would leave in your house to show off and collect dust. The porcelain carriage doors won’t open, which is especially strange since I opened them so easily before and the texture on them didn’t feel this way before. Thankfully though, I left everything in the back of the carriage and my possessions are still here along with the strange weapon the man gave me. I take my suitcase and the long case that contains the weapon and walk through the city. This appears to be a ghost town with not a noise being made anywhere with only the sound of the wind to remind me that I haven’t gone deaf. I do see shadows that dart around the corners of buildings and windows.
“Hello! Hello?” I say to try to get one of the people’s attention, but none answer back and only retreat into the darkness.
With nowhere to really go to, I arrive at what looks to be a hotel. The hotel doors are open and yet, there’s no one here like the rest of the city. I ring the service bell on the hotel’s desk several times without an answer. On further inspection, there’s a note that says to leave a certain amount of money on the desk and I’ll receive a key a few moments later. I do as the note says with nothing else to do and search the hotel for signs of life. What seems to be sounds of laughter, whimpering, and mumbling coming from several of the rooms. I knock on the doors to try to get their attention, but no one answers the doors. A dinging sound that sounds like someone dropped a key is made downstairs and I return to find a key where I left my money. This is indeed a strange city.
“Thank you, whoever left this key for me,” I say.
…no response again. There’s nothing I think I can do right now so I go to the room this key belongs to and enter the room. It’s actually really nice and well decorated for the price I paid. I check my pistol, the ammo I have for it, my spare clothes, and the weapon the man gave me before I decide to take a quick rest. Maybe people will be out early tomorrow morning? Do they have some kind of curfew that says they must be in this early? I cannot fathom why a city that is supposedly famous for having the healing blood of Jesus Christ Himself would be like this. Nevertheless, tomorrow will hopefully give me some kind of answer.
 
 

Chapter 1 – The First Blood that is Spilled Can Fill the Ocean
A scream awakens me from my sleep and it appears that I haven’t slept for long as the sun is still setting though it’s a bit lower than before. I quickly take my pistol and head downstairs to see a nun in white. She appears to be a young adult though what’s strange is, is that she’s carrying a sword.
“Are you okay sister?” I ask.
“Why yes. I heard a scream and came here to see if anyone was in trouble.”
“That wasn’t you? Why are you carrying a sword?”
“Well, not all nuns are defenseless, especially in this town. You should get a better weapon than that pistol if you wish to survive the night.”
“What do you mean?”
“You’ll see soon enough.”
“I got a scythe upstairs in my room, will that do?”
“Let me see it.”
I lead her upstairs and show her the weapon. She runs her hands through the weapon with an interested look on her face.
“You must’ve gotten this weapon from God Himself,” she says.
“Really?”
“You see this cross on the weapon? This cross is embedded into the weapon with a special material that blesses the weapon with immense strength.”
This explains the strange man and how weird it was on how I got here, but it’s strange that God Himself would lead someone like me here. I’m just an ordinary man or rather a waste of skin since I don’t do much for people.
“Can you wield this?” the nun continues.
“I have some experience wielding weapons, but not really.”
“You should be good then. Here, wield this weapon of God.”
I take the scythe and it’s lighter than I thought it would be. As I move the weapon’s blade through the air, it feels like I’m wielding a feather.
“We should go to the church,” the nun says, “It’s going to be safer there for us.”
“Ok. Are we going to ask the other people here to join us?”
“No, we regretfully won’t. You can hear their cries and laughter of madness, don’t you?”
“I can but-”
“I’m sorry but we must leave before they…I’ll explain along the way.”
We leave the hotel and make our way to the church. The church is the biggest building in the city which can be seen from most places in the city. Along the way, she starts to explain herself and the situation.
“My name is Sister Magdalene. I’m from the Holy Church of Jesus’ Blood and this town is suffering from an unusual curse. People here disappear and, in their place, come beasts that look like goats. These beasts come out at night and indiscriminately kill people then go back into hiding when the sun rises. They can only be scratched with regular weaponry, so we have to bless our weapons to hurt them. The church and the citizens here have been doing our best to get rid of all the beasts and eliminate the source, but we haven’t been too successful as our numbers dwindle with each passing day. There also doesn’t seem to be an exit for us as the only exit appears to be jumping into the abyss around the city.”
“Abyss? When I got here, it looked as normal as it can be.”
“You’re an outsider? You really are a blessing from God.”
“I don’t know about that. I just came here to see if the healing blood of Christ was true.”
“Oh, it is. I will give you some later if you wish.”
“Yes, please. I’d love to share your gift with the rest of the world.”
“Tis’ not my gift, but the gift of God. You truly are a blessing since you are here to spread our healing to the world.”
Again, I don’t know about that.
“So how did you obtain this blood?”
“We were given it by a stranger who drives a carriage. Once we confirmed the effects of the blood, he disappeared with his horses as if he was never there. His carriage was burned to ashes and his horses rotted on the ground with maggots in them.”
“That sounds similar to my carriage driver but not exactly mine. My carriage driver’s horses and carriage turned to porcelain.”
“Regardless of that minor difference, I truly believe that you are-”
“Yes sister, you’ve said what you believe I am many times already.”
“Yes, but I thought I’d reaffirm it-”
We suddenly hear a beastly scream that echoes throughout the city. It sounds like a goat mixed in with what I can only call a demon.
Magdalene draws her sword then says, “Prepare yourself…”
“Ashton. My apologies for not stating my name earlier.”
“You mustn’t worry about that now. Just draw your weapon.”
I draw my scythe and wait for the beast to show itself…wherever it is. In somewhat of a panic, I look around my surroundings and try to look for signs of the monster.
“Calm yourself, Ashton. You will know when it shows itself.”
Right…I’m calm now after a few breaths in and out and sure enough, the beast shows itself. It creeps out of the darkness with its goat demon head and big lanky body with barely any hair on it. Its skin also seems to be soaked in light blood as if it just killed its latest prey.
“Fear not Ashton for we are the hunters of these beasts and they are the prey. Now, attack without mercy!”
Magdalene charges in to attack and I follow. She goes on the left side of it and I go to the right. The beast lunges and swipes at both of us to try to break our pincer attack, but we dodge out of the way. Magdalene manages to slice off the arm of the beast with lightning speed before it has a chance to retract its arm. I follow her counterattack lead by raises my scythe and slicing the beast several times though it isn’t taken down so easily, so I quickly make the weapon switch itself to the ax to give one heavy finishing blow. After switching the weapon back and wiping some of the blood of me, Magdalene approaches me and begins to wipe the blade with her clothes.
Confused, I pull the weapon away then say, “What are you doing?”
“A weapon such as this doesn’t deserve to be dirty for so long.”
“Can’t we just wait to wash it at church?”
“We do have Holy water that would definitely improve the blade and make it clean. Ok then. I’ll wait,” Magdalene then gives me a smile that gives me a bit of unease, “You are truly blessed.”
“Thank you.”
What’s up with this city? Even Magdalene appears to be strange. We encounter a few more beasts along the way which is good practice for me as they don’t appear to be too much trouble for me despite their bloodthirsty way of fighting. This weapon is truly something special. It really makes my pistol look like a child’s toy when I try it on the beasts. Bullets don’t appear to have any effect on the beasts though Magdalene says that someone in the church could help improve it. After those encounters, we make it to a barricade in front of the walls of the church. There are people everywhere with torches, pitchforks, swords, and other weaponry but at least they appear to be normal.
Suddenly, Magdalene raises my hand that’s holding the scythe and proclaims, “Blessed is this dark night, for God has sent us a knight that will free us from this prison and spread His gift to the world.”
The crowd cheers for me. This what it must feel like to be celebrated, but I don’t feel like this is earned. Magdalene leads me through the crowd and they touch my shoulders while bowing and blessing me. They all seem so grateful for even receiving what seems to be a ray of hope. I guess shouldn’t do anything to spoil this and just help them in any way I can. As we approach the church walls, I see men and women with bows, crossbows, and rifles, above on the walls sniping what I assume to be beasts. The gate opens and there is a clergy of priests and nuns who are holding similar weapons to Magdalene.
“Sister Magdalene,” one of the priests say, “is this true that you’ve brought a gift from God?”
“It is true. I’ve heard his story and seen him fight. This man will give us great things,” she responds.
“We will see. What brings you here?”
“We are here to prepare him for saving us from this curse, bless his pistol, and give him a taste of the sacred blood of Christ.”
“Very well. Proceed though do be sure to check up on Lawrence if you can find him. He was posted on the inside of the front church doors, but no one can find him.”
“I’m sure he’s just resting or sharpening his blades.”
“Oh, those theories have not lost my mind, I am just merely telling you the situation with him.”
“I know. I’ll speak to you later. I must be on my way to help Sir Ashton.”
“Blessed be the path you walk.”
“Thank you.”
We both bow to each other and Magdalene and I continue up the church stairs.
“Who’s Lawrence?” I ask.
“The Holy Blade of the Church and one of the first church hunters. He lead many hunts on many nights so he has amassed much skill, strength, and glory.”
“And I’m a great blessing for this city? Lawrence sounds like your greatest blessing.”
“He’s one of them, but you alone have the tools to free us.”
“Whatever you say.”
As we approach the castle gates and open them, an unease creeps into me and with each inch the church’s front doors I see the reason why. The walls and ceiling are covered in blood and gore with mangled bodies that litter the ground. Magdalene and I are speechless as we walk into the church. A dismembered corpse manages to get up and we get to their aid.
The dismembered person says to us, “Ahh…ahh…please help us. An indescribable beast approaches. Lawrence the Abomination is hunting again. Please…God have mercy…have mercy on us all…hahaha!”
A terrible amalgamation of flesh, body parts, and beast approaches us on all fours. Its screech seems to be a combination of human, beast, and unimaginable horrors.
Though Magdalene is in more shock than I am, she reaches out to it while uttering the words, “Lawrence…is that you?”
The beast sets its sights on her and charges at her. I have to pull her out of the way to get her to move.
“Now is not the time for this!” I say while switching my scythe to the ax.
She slaps her face a bit before nodding and readying her sword. To beat this beast, we have to think on our feet as it seems adept at fighting us at the same time with wild flails of its body parts and charges to run away and make us swing at each other. Even so, a beast is still a beast and it falls, but then it catches a glimpse of something among the corpses. It reaches out one of its hands and grabs a huge greatsword. Its eyes seem captivated by it and as it grips it, it grows in size to match the beast’s size.
The monstrosity then lifts the sword to the ceiling and proclaims, “I am Lawrence the Holy Blade of the Church and I will fight as a Knight of God’s Will.”
It then stands on two feet and brings the sword in front of it as an honorable knight would. Though it doesn’t transform in any way, it seems to have taken the form of what I assume to be who Lawrence was and this brings tears to Magdalene’s face though she does not falter.
She shouts, “Lawrence! Honorable Knight of God’s Will! We will free you from your suffering!”
He fights more like a knight now that he’s gained some of his humanity back, which is more difficult for us now that can block and even parry attacks, but I feel more motivated to fight him. He’s a warrior who must be given an honorable death lest he goes down in history as a monster. With my weapon’s special ability, I get a great idea. I intentionally crash blows with Lawrence then switch my ax to the scythe which allows me to forcefully push his sword down to the ground which also slams him to the ground. I then spin and switch my weapon mid-swing to deliver the final blow, cutting off Lawrence’s head. The rest of the body melts into a sludge of blood though the head still remains and appears to be talking. Magdalene and I go to it to hear what he is saying.
“Forgive me, Magdalene,” he says, “The blood of beasts has consumed me and corrupted my body. Tell me…are the hunters of the church still fighting with hope and honor in their hearts?”
“Yes,” Magdalene says with tears still flowing from their face, “Yes, they are, and they will continue to fight as long as the sun shines in the sky.”
“Good. That gives me peace. Now…I’m afraid I must leave you again. God is calling His sword to its sheath…”
As Lawrence takes his last breath, Magdalene holds the head of her deformed friend and honorable knight and mourns his passing. I put my hand on her shoulder to give her some comfort, but then she stands up almost immediately.
She wipes the tears off her face then says, “I thank you for your help, but I mustn’t’ let this slow me down. Lawrence would’ve wanted us to not slow down for him and to just deliver salvation for the people he defended so valiantly. Now…let us improve your weaponry for the night has just begun.”
 
 
 

Chapter 2 – More Enemies, More Blood
We inform everyone what happened in the church and they’re just as shocked as we were. They try to help the injured though most if not all won’t live. Others help bury the corpses in the graveyard behind the church and clean the bloody mess that is everywhere, but I doubt that they’ll wash these bloodstains out of the floors and walls. In the meantime, Magdalene shows me how to improve my weaponry by cleaning it with Holy water and using a special kind of smelter with iron that gives it a very special quality. As for my pistol, she gives me special silver bullets that are better than regular ones and adds in different mechanisms that let it fire faster and load more than a few bullets into it, twelve to be exact. She also gives me a vial of what is supposed to be the Blood of Christ.
She tells me, “Please deliver the world the salvation it deserves.”
“I promise.”
“You can always get more here so don’t hesitate to heal yourself with it if you’re injured.”
Someone then barges into the room and says, “The beasts are coming!”
“Ashton, grab your scythe! It should be ready now.”
I grab the scythe and it feels exceptionally more different than it did before. Lighter, more versatile, deadlier. Magdalene, the rest of the hunters, and I exit the church to see the almost war-like state the outside is with beasts crawling and killing all over the place. We go to help, and I test out my new weaponry which works wonders. The pistol stuns and kills beasts with only one to two shots while the scythe cuts through them like butter and the switch to the ax is faster which is more destructive than before.
Magdalene turns to look at me then says, “Ashton!”
I turn to look where she is staring at right before a large dark grey hand grabs me and pulls me up and over the church walls. As it drags me through the city, I witness beasts crawling out of the darkness and woodwork as if the dark of the night itself births these creatures. They climb and crawl all over the city while killing people and heading for the church. Few take note of me and fewer chase after me since I’m being pulled at such a fast speed. I can’t really move my weapons at all though I still try to force my way out of this monster’s grip. It eventually pulls me on top of the city’s walls and lets me go here just to see the void between this city and where I came from. What was that hand’s purpose and why did it show me this just to fade into the darkness below? There’s no time to ponder such questions now as I must get back to Magdalene to help her and the others.
The streets seem awfully quiet after what I just witnessed but I still stay ready with both weapons in hand, ready for a bloody fight. I look up at the sky to see that there’s a blood moon out tonight. How appropriate. Blood and wreckage fill some of the streets with few bodies here and there. Thankfully some of the bodies are beasts so at least there are others here to fight them and help me. The further I go the stranger things I see and I’m not just talking about the lack of beasts who are probably just concentrating on the beasts. I find bodies of beasts who look somewhat human near houses, water fountains, and crosses. Even stranger, I find the exact opposite near the exact same landmarks. They all appear to have been killed or just killed themselves by hanging, gunshot or stab to the throat. I eventually stumble across one person who is slightly turned.
“Do not worry friend. I have the healing blood with me,” I say to him as I take out the blood vial.
The person stops me and says in a frightened tone, “Do not give me that accursed blood. It has killed more people than it can heal and-”
This person and many others around him start to transform into the beasts I see around the city, so I’m forced to fight and kill them. These ones have a more crimson look to their skin and are faster and stronger than the others as they can carve straight through the sides of nearby houses. Thankfully my skills and new weapons help me survive this skirmish with only a few scrapes and scratches. Is the blood the source of the beasts and madness among the citizens? It can’t be…can it?
Further along the way, I’m ambushed and put into a corner by these new crimson beasts. Suddenly, a few of them fall from strikes behind them and before the rest notice, they are slain.
A man in hunter attire walks over their bodies and greets me, “How do you do fellow hunter?”
“I’m alive thanks to you. You have my gratitude.”
“My name is Bradford. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”
“Mine is Ashton.”
“What are you doing here Ashton? Looking to fight the more challenging beasts?”
“No, I was dragged from the church to the walls and now I’m trying to get back.”
“Don’t bother with that accursed church and faith. They’re what started this plague of beasts and endless nights.”
Right…so he’s not too fond of the church.
“Do you know if this blood is the source of all of this?”
“It appears to be though I’m not sure why. A few alchemists and I are performing experiments on the blood to see what it truly is.”
“You do not think it is the Blood of Christ?”
“I am not a religious man so that is not on my mind. You should come with me to help us free this city and topple the church.”
Hmmm, what do I do…I should probably confirm the curse’s origins with Magdalene or at least save her for helping me start in the city. I shouldn’t be too quick to trust this man either.
“I will later but I must help a friend who is in trouble.”
“Very well then. I will not force your hand. Farewell and good hunting.”
He took that very well as if it wasn’t any trouble at all I should get back to the church now. With only a few more encounters with other beasts and the new crimson ones, I make it back to the church walls. There are only a few citizens guarding the entrance with no bodies on the ground for some reason despite the blood. They don’t appear to be well thought they look a bit better than the person I saw previously but I should still be careful. I approach the walls with caution while paying attention to the odd citizens they don’t seem to pay attention to me, so things are normal? Whoa! An ax comes down on me when I turn to look forward. Thankfully my reflexes are still sharp, so I dodge out of the way before it nicks me. This was their plan. They acted normal so I can walk in the center of their trap. These people aren’t beasts, but they attack me like beasts. They’re out of their mind so I have no choice but to defend myself. First, I killed beasts and now I’m killing people though from what I’ve recently seen, I’m not sure that the two are so different. These “beasts” go down more easily than the other ones but they can still use guns and reload them as if some part of their brains still remember this. Though I’m at a disadvantage, I’m also at a great advantage with my long reaching scythe and ax and my pistol that kills the “beasts” with guns in one shot. That was honestly easier to handle than I thought it would be, but my experience here makes my fighting style more bloodthirsty aggressive than the way I previously fought.
There’s no more time to waste. If these people have turned, then I fear what must’ve happened in the church. The giant church wall doors are open enough, so I can move through and when I make it past the walls, a giant-sized devil beast jumps from behind the walls and lands in front of me. It’s hairier and more covered in blood than the other beasts with three heads. The body and arms are massive though its legs are much thinner and longer. Its head and horns are unmistakably goat-like as the rest but a bit more demon-like. I start to engage head on it despite its intimating nature and uncanny screech. My scythe cuts through its arms and body, spraying its crimson blood all over the place but it doesn’t appear to injure the beast too heavily like Lawrence. To defend itself, it swipes at me with its arms and long nails and jumps around to avoid some of my attacks. Killing this beast by myself is going to be a worthy challenge. This battle makes me excited to fight, to slice, to spill blood…haha…damn it. I’ve got to stay focused! I use my pistol to hit the beasts head when it charges up for a huge attack to stun it for my final attacks. My scythe isn’t strong enough to slice through its legs, so I switch to the ax and cut off its legs. The beast still tries to fight despite massive blood loss, so I cut the beast from the bottom of the body up to the chest, which gets massive amounts of blood on me. It still lives and tries to fight back though its attacks are pathetic. The heart is exposed and, on the floor, and still attached to it so I rip it out and squash it with my hands. This finally kills the beast and makes it melt into a crimson flesh mess. Whew…that was exciting. Now then, back to Magdalene.
I walk up the church steps and go through its doors to find Magdalene with others who are helping her tend to the wounded. She sees me almost immediately and runs over to hug me.
“Ashton! God bless you, you’re alive! Are you hurt?”
“No, I’m fine Magdalene even though I’m drenched in blood. I just fought this huge beast that jumped over the church walls and other citizens that have turned.”
“That’s truly dreadful, but amazing at the same time that you survived it all. It shows that you’re-”
“Truly blessed right?”
“You know me so well. Please, rest up for a bit. I’ll clean your weapons and your clothes so we both can go out again and put an end to this night.”
“Haha. More work? Don’t let me rest for too long.”
“Hahaha. You’re right. A hunters’ duty ends when the night does, but you should really rest.”
“I will. I will.”
But seriously don’t let me rest for long. There’s more blood to be shed.
 
 
 

Chapter 3 – Painting the Town Red
After my weapons are spruced up a bit and my clothes are cleaned, I suit up to go back out. While getting dressed, I catch Magdalene peeking into the room I’m in. She quickly closes the door once she sees I noticed.
“Haha. Peeking at a man getting dressed Magdalene? I thought nuns were pure of heart.”
She enters the room and says, “I am. I uh I was just checking on you.”
“Sure you were. Is this the first time you’ve seen a man partially dressed?”
“No. I’ve seen plenty of men partially dressed. Naked even.”
“Want to elaborate?”
“Not at this moment. It’s something in the past I wish to keep there.”
“I understand. I won’t push any further.”
Magdalene continues to stare at me with some kind of lust in her eyes while I get dressed.
I ask her, “I’ve heard rumors that the source of this curse of beasts is the Blood of Christ. Is that true?”
The look on her face changes back to normal as she says, “No of course not! It’s true that the curse came to this city after we got the Holy Blood, but it is not confirmed as many people here have taken the blood since it first got here and they’re perfectly sane and healthy.”
“What about those people outside the church walls? They attacked me as if I were a beast. Also, what about those priests that you were with? The church must’ve had the most access to it and they probably used it the most.”
“I don’t how much blood the citizens that guarded the walls took though they were given a fair share of it as payment for their services. The priests here experimented along with the alchemists here, so I would ask them, but they aren’t here. They went out to search for you and have yet to return. I fear their fate since the three have yet to return as well.”
“We have to ask the alchemists then. Do you know where we can find them?”
“Yes, but I’m not too fond of them. They don’t believe in God as much as everyone else and try to disprove His existence.”
“They’re just trying to prove everything with material facts, so I wouldn’t pay any mind to them.”
“But God’s existence can’t be proved with material facts alone!”
“I know I know Magdalene, but we still need to visit them to help get rid of this curse. Can you please put your bias aside for the time being?”
“For you, of course, I will. You are-”
“Yes, sister I know what you say I am.”
“But-”
I put my finger on her mouth.
“I know. Let’s go now.”
She smiles and nods her head. We leave the church in the hands of fellow hunters and go to search for the alchemists who hopefully have information we can use. Along the way, we encounter several monsters and mad men. The entire town appears to be full of them with no normal man, woman, or even child in sight. Some of the beasts are miniature and fast. I pray in my head that these are just animals and not actual children.
“These streets are getting too dangerous,” I say, “Let’s take a different path.”
We run through several connected alleys and get ambushed by crows, dogs, and rodents that walk on two feet like men. Several of them appear to be combined together as if they are the product of a Frankenstein experiment.
Magdalene says, “This is the product of those alchemists’ work! I’ve seen these beasts in their labs before!”
“I’ll be sure to talk to them about it then. First, we have to survive and find them.”
My pistol takes care of these and the child-like beasts with one shot and my scythe cuts through them like butter. Our path is clear and yet, we constantly stop and take a different path. It’s like the beasts are making it seem like we can go where we want then they push us in a particular direction.
“Do you know where we’re going, Magdalene?”
“An altar in the center of the city where we celebrated our receiving of the healing blood.”
“Do you have any idea why we’re being pushed there?”
“I have no idea. I thought they would keep us from getting to a place like that.”
This can’t be a good sign. The beasts are unrelenting and there doesn’t seem to be an end to them nor the bloodshed nor the night. We arrive at the alter that the townsfolk have set up on top of many stairs. We are pushed to the very top and the beasts don’t attack us there.
A very demonic voice calls out from the darkness of the city, “Behold for the Anti-Christ shall be born from this whore!”
“What are you talking about?!” I scream back at it.
“Do you really believe this nun is truly virtuous? She greeted men of conflict and law enforcement with sex and pleasure. She is more of a pagan temple prostitute than a Christian nun, therefore it is her body, which is laced with demonic blood, that will birth the Anti-Christ.”
Magdalene holds her stomach and cries out in pain as her stomach inflates and gives birth to an abomination. I can hear the beasts and demons of hell howl and wail out as they shake their fists to the sky.
“Kill me, Ashton,” Magdalene says as she grabs my arm, “You cannot let this demon into this world!”
“I-I…”
“Do it!”
I switch my scythe to an ax, hold it up in the air over Magdalene’s stomach for a few seconds, close my eyes then bring down the ax on her and the monster. When I open my eyes, I can still see Magdalene twitching and movement in her body. This damned thing must be keeping her alive to be born.
“Die!” I repeatedly shout as I smash the unborn child into the ground.
Magdalene’s lower body is in pieces now along with what was supposed to be the Anti-Christ. The beasts of the night that surround us retreat from the altar in fear. I fall to my knees in exhaustion. Is this what God wanted me to do? Is my purpose in this world done? If so, then take me from this world…Nothing.
I pick myself up and look around to see that the city appears to be empty now. Oh, I see a light in a building not too far from here. Smoke appears to be coming out of the chimney so that’s probably where Bradford is. I go there with no resistance from any of the beasts. Whenever I think I hear or see one, it runs away from me. If nothing else, at least they’ll stop bothering me. That demonic voice said Magdalene had demonic blood laced with her own. That must mean my worst fears are confirmed. The man in a carriage who gave these people the “Blood of Christ” actually gave them the corrupted blood of demons. It probably was no man at all and was just Satan in the flesh. I should probably throw away this vial of blood Magdalene gave me, but I don’t know where to dispose of it. From what I’ve seen, the vermin of the city will just drink it up and become monsters so there has to be a good place to hide it or get rid of it completely. If I can do this, I’m sure my purpose here will be complete, but what about the town? The people in the church will probably scum to the beasts or the cursed blood so God might just deal with it like how He dealt with Sodom and Gomorrah.
Now I’m around where that building I saw is. Wait, what was-oh more new beasts. This one has eyes on its body, more than one face, and elongated arms and legs like some perverse version of a cherubim. It leaps from the roof and attacks me. It’s way nimbler than the other beasts and even dodges my pistol shoots and the slices from my scythe. A barrage of rifle shots from the darkness take it out and I turn to see Bradford and a couple other people who I assume to be his fellow hunters. He takes off his hood to reveal his flowing blond hair. Before I could see only a few features of his face and now I can see he has quite the ladies’ man look.
“Ashton,” he says, “I assume you took care of your friend?”
“Yes, I have.”
“I saw from a distance. You have my apologies for not being there with you.”
“It’s okay. It was my purpose for being here.”
“If it truly was, then let me help you get out of this twisted fate.”
 
 
 
 
 

Chapter 4 – Seeing Clearly with New Eyes
We go to Bradford’s place and it is a place of alchemy and natural philosophy or science as some people say. People here are experimenting with weapons, the blood from the beasts, and the dead bodies of the beasts themselves.
“What Magdalene said was true then. You are responsible for some of the beasts outside,” I say to Bradford and his colleagues.
“We were just experimenting with the blood that the church gave us. Of course, there’s going to be failures when we’re dealing with the unknown,” Bradford explains, “We aren’t even close to knowing even half of what this blood is capable of and the church just decided to use it just because it could cure any disease or injury. This is how we got into the situation we are in today. We’re going to get out of this accursed city then experiment with the blood until we can use it for good.”
“Experiment with the blood? Didn’t you hear the demonic voice say that this blood is the blood of demons?”
“I didn’t hear that, and I don’t believe it. If it is the blood of a demon, then we can possibly purify it so that it is the blood of an angel. Maybe then it can be used without worry.”
“These are all just unproven theories in your head. Enough death and destruction have taken place because of it so let’s just get rid of the blood you have, burn the beasts, and let’s leave this place!”
“He’s right, Bradford,” one of his colleagues say, “We’ve been researching this blood for months now and we’ve learned nothing new.”
“This blood has killed our families and friends and destroyed all of our lives,” another chimes in, “We should destroy it and leave this God-forsaken place!”
Several other of Bradford’s colleagues agree with me and voice their disdain for experimenting with this blood.
“Enough!” Bradford says, “We will do as Ashton and you say and leave this city as soon as we destroy this blood, which of course you know is easier said than done, but I know of a quick way to do so. It came up in my research-”
“And you didn’t tell us?”
“No, because I never thought I would have to. There are three parts of a celestial body that has elements in it that will get rid of this blood to the last drop. The only difficulty is that the places were quarantined off by the city and guarded by royal guards who have had the blood since it came to us so they’re going to be extremely dangerous.”
“I will go with you then,” I instantly volunteer.
“I figured you would. Since we are low on fighting power, the last of you will stay here, hold down the fort, and try to get rid of this poisonous blood as soon as possible. Agreed?”
“Agreed,” we all say.
“Good. Let’s get to work gentlemen.”
Bradford grabs a bag to carry the parts of the celestial body, ammo for our guns, and a marked map that shows the location of the bodies parts. We head off to the closest location and encounter more of those many-eyed beasts. To avoid difficult fights, we cautiously move and use the pitch-black shadows to our advantage.
Along the way, I whisper to Bradford, “Where did these beasts come from? Don’t tell me this was your fault as well.”
“In a way it is. Some of the researchers and priests who had excessive amounts of exposure to the blood became beasts like the ones you see. I didn’t stop or warn them of the possible negative effects because I wanted to see what would happen,” he responds.
“Curiosity kills the cat you know!”
“Curiosity is also what evolves humanity, so we can advance as a species.”
“That doesn’t mean you should let your fellow man suffer to help everyone else.”
“What’s the suffering of a few people compared to the joy of the millions?”
“You can’t value the suffering of people like that!”
“Save your arguing for the ethics committee. We’re here.”
We break through a wooden door then go down a long set of stairs to find a small room with an iron door. The door has the sentence, “Obtain the eyes of an angel to your left or walk in the void”.
“Yeah right,” Bradford says before opening the door that leads to complete darkness.
He tries to use a nearby wall lamp to light the darkness, but it doesn’t make anything visible in the room. I look to the left to see a place where I’m supposed to look into. The inscription below it says, “Only the faithful will survive obtaining the eyes of an angel”.
“Ashton. You’re one of the faithful, aren’t you?” Bradford says.
“Yes, so I assume I have to do this. Hopefully, it won’t be painful,” I say as I look into the eyeholes-, “AAAAAHHH!”
“Ashton! Are you okay?!”
“No, I’m not! That piece of shit just plucked out my eyes and stabbed me in the eye sockets!”
I can hear Bradford tearing a piece of cloth off his clothes. I’m covering my eye holes since they’re bleeding and in enormous pain.
“Never thought I’d hear a believer like you curse.”
“Just shut up and give me a bandage! Do you have any medicine on you?”
“I regretfully don’t, but here’s this for now. Move your hands.”
He puts something around my head.
“Is this some kind of joke Bradford? You didn’t put anything on my head. I’m lucky that thing didn’t take away my sight and I’m no longer in pain.”
“What are you talking about? I put a piece of my cloak on your head.”
“No, you didn’t. Even if you did, I can see right through it.”
“How many fingers am I holding up?”
“You aren’t holding up any fingers.”
“What about now?”
“Nine.”
“Do you still have your eyes after what happened? Oh crap, no you don’t! How can you see without your eyes?!”
“I don’t have any eyes?! You must be joking because I can see clearly!”
“I’m not joking! Put this bandage back on for now because I don’t want to look at two empty eye holes.”
I put it on and for some reason, I can see right through it.
“Ashton, try looking into the room now.”
Looking into the room, I can see everything in it as if the room was never dark to begin with.
“I can see everything in it now.”
“Wow, miraculous.”
“I guess this turned you into a believer, didn’t it?”
“In a way.”
“Here, I’ll guide you.”
I take Bradford’s hand and walk him through the room, which is normal for the most part though Bradford does manage to still fall over and bump into things.
“You’re a klutz,” I tell him.
“I’m as blind as bat in this room!”
“You’re saying that to the man who literally doesn’t have any eyes.”
“Shut up!”
We make it through the room and come to a cavern.
“I can see now Ashton.”
“Good. I don’t want to hold your hand any longer.”
We explore the linear cavern until we come to an altar room with three people surrounding a body part. One person has a katana, the other has a claymore, and the last has a pike. Once they look at us, we see that they have snakes as their body.
“There’s no end to many types of beasts,” I say.
“I will not be defeated by mere serpents,” Bradford adds.
These creatures move like the many-eyed beasts, but my eyes adjust to their movement, so I can slice at them no matter where they move. I manage to take down two of them while Bradford is still struggling to land a single hit on the one he takes on. Feeling charitable, I slice his enemy in half for him.
“I had that thing on the ropes,” he says.
“I can tell.”
We take the lower half of the celestial body and leave the lower area of the city. The many-eyed beasts ambush us, but they are no challenge to me with my new eyes or rather lack thereof. I can see every small movement they make. My side vision even picks up on their sneak attacks.
After the battle, Bradford asks me, “I guess we don’t need to go back to my workshop for medication, do we?”
“Does it look like it?”
Now that I’m really looking at Bradford, he appears to have a strange red aura about him, which makes sense because of the man’s character. We continue on nevertheless as I keep a close eye on him.
 
 
 
 

Chapter 5 – Without Form
We have to go through the residential area to find this next celestial body part. Along the way, we’re attacked by every form of beast that I’ve previously met.  They don’t pose a challenge to me now because of my enhanced vision. Now I can effectively wield my weapon as it was meant to be. A blade that cuts through flesh as if it was the air. It seems that we’ve killed most of the beasts in the city and now…all appears to be quiet, so Bradford and I just peacefully stroll under the blood moonlit night. Peacefully strolling while covered in the blood of beasts, but peacefully strolling nonetheless.
“How did you learn about the celestial body and how is it the cure for the demonic blood?” I ask Bradford to fill my curiosity.
“Legends and myths about fantastical events that happened in history,” he answers.
“You mean events like miracles and the resurrection?”
“Of course. After what happened to you, I’m starting to believe in the supernatural.”
“Only after what happened to me? What did those legends exactly tell you that makes you think the celestial bodies have the cure?”
“The elements within it, the nature of anything good purifying evil, and the various other things I had written down. I can’t remember everything exactly, but it should work.”
“You’re asking me to take a leap of faith with you?”
“Yes, but not in the way the church asks you. I have several foundational ideas that make my idea a step over a gap and not a leap of faith.”
“Did you know that faith is based on several foundational ideas and not just blind jumping?”
“In a way, I guess I do see it now, but not fully.”
“Think about this then. You have to have faith that nature continues to act in a consistent nature in order to do your tests and experiments. You have to have faith that the people you love won’t turn on you in an instant. You can trust them as much as you want, but you’ll never know what they’re truly thinking all the time. They could be just acting like they love you and betray you later.”
“I see your point. But what about the unseen?”
“Mathematics is unseen, and you use it. Morality is not written down in stone but is written on the hearts of men in their souls. They are a set of rules that everyone follows and yet, no one can empirically prove what is good and what is evil or even change what they are.”
“I didn’t know that you were such a philosopher.”
“Oh, I’m not. I’m just repeating what I learned from my priests and other teachers.”
“You’ve definitely peaked my interest. After this, we should talk about it more. We’re here.”
We’ve arrived at an orphanage, school, church hybrid.
“The celestial body part is here?” I ask Bradford.
“That’s right. It looks fairly innocent, so why would you expect them to keep anything secret here?”
“That’s clever.”
“It put children in danger.”
“I’m sure they had the best guards like the ones we faced guarding it.”
“I hope so.”
Bradford and I enter the orphanage and there doesn’t appear to be any signs of struggle or bloodshed here. There’s barely a speck of dust on the desks and chairs in this place as if someone is still living here.
“Someone might be here,” I warn Bradford.
“I’ll be on my guard then, but who would keep this place up with everything that’s happening outside?”
“Let’s find out.”
We wander through the halls with our weapons out and ready. An eerie silence fills the halls along the stench of the blood on us. Looking through each room that looks like we could find something, we find nothing but neat and clean classrooms, orphan rooms, and offices. The papers in the offices don’t mention anything that we’re looking for and only talk about the behavior of the children they took care of. The sound of movement in the halls get our attention.
“…Is anyone there?” I say with hesitation.
Silence responds to me, so I motion Bradford to follow me and he nods. We creep around the corner to find an empty room, that is until we see a cloaked figure walking through the halls. It appears to be wearing a nun’s outfits, but it has a tattered appearance to it. A book that appears to be a Bible is in her hands, but her hands are shaking.
“Excuse me, sister,” Bradford says to the nun.
I pull him back.
“What is it, Ashton?”
“Take a closer look at her.”
“I don’t notice anything. Are those new eyes of yours showing you something I don’t see?”
“She doesn’t have an aura. The beasts don’t have auras either.”
The nun turns to us and reveals a hollow dress. It then transforms so that multiple nuns come out of the dress with swords in their hands. Its form expands and starts to take up the entire hallway. Bradford and I run to the roof and it breaks its way through the roof to confront us. At least we have space to fight it now. We attack in a pincer way so that all of its attacks aren’t concentrated on us. The way its arms swing is almost on par with my scythe. I shoot at the beast, but my shots just go through the cloak as if spirits are controlling it. The beast hums a lullaby as it fights, which starts to take its toll on us for some reason. To try to end the fight faster by focusing on slicing off the multiple arms and this stops the humming after each extra nun dress is cut off.
Bradford appears to be making progress as well, but he concentrates more on not getting sliced to pieces. Now that most of the dress is sliced to pieces, we cut into the center, which completely stops the humming. With that out of the way, we’re fully awake and slice through the center multiple times finished off by one strong attack by the both of us. The beast then explodes into pieces and black fabric starts to rain from the sky.
“That will hopefully be the last nun I have to deal with,” Bradford says while being exhausted.
“I don’t blame you,” I respond, “Now let’s find-oh…is this it?”
A radiant looking torso is on the ground and appears to have come from the nun’s dress because of the fabric attached to it.
“It is! We only have one more body piece to find!”
“Whose celestial body do the legends say this belonged to?”
“Adam, the first man.”
“Why are you sure that his body will be the cure?”
“Because the legends say so. You trust me, don’t you? Have a little faith.”
“Since when did you become a believer?”
“Everything that I’ve seen made me one. Do you trust me?”
“Nothing that you’ve done has given me a reason not to.”
“Good man Ashton. We’ll get through this, go to a bar, and everything will be on me.”
I hope that Bradford is telling the truth. If he does end up doing something crafty, I’ll have to start planning now.
 
 

Chapter 6 – The Sum of All Suffering
Again, Bradford and I walk the streets of the city to get to our next location. It appears that we’ve killed every beast in the city since we’ve been walking for a while without even hearing the wind blow. My new eyes don’t pick up on anything either so we appear to be in the clear.
“Tell me, Ashton, how is God present in our lives right now?”
“He sent me here. How else do you explain me getting over the bridge and obtaining this weapon?”
“You just arrived from outside the city?”
“I did. I don’t think I mentioned that to you yet. A carriage driver, who I assume to be God now, told me about this place and took me here. His carriage turned to porcelain after he dropped me off here.”
“That’s interesting, but how is God helping us right now? What makes you think that he cares about what’s going on?”
“He sent me here with this weapon and without me being here, the Anti-Christ would’ve been born, and you wouldn’t be able to get these pieces of the body of Adam.”
“And yet he couldn’t have just changed everything in an instant?”
“He could’ve, but then he wouldn’t be dealing justice on the church for being so blind in their faith and on your alchemists and you for doing all of your unethical experiments.”
“But we were doing them to help humanity.”
“The means don’t justify the ends. You’re not doing anything for the benefit of anyone if you try to justify evil acts done for the greater good. You might as well justify the killing of the poor and homeless to get rid of poverty.”
“…I guess you’re right. I might have to rethink some of my plans.”
“What plans? What are you thinking about?”
“Nothing that you should concern yourself with now. You’ve changed me, I’ll admit that. I promise I won’t do anything that might cause anyone any more suffering. Believe me.”
“For now, I will. Just know that I’ll have to watch what you’re going to do to make sure you’re doing the right thing.”
“Don’t worry, I’m sure you’ll approve of what I have in mind.”
I hope so.
“Tell me, Ashton. What makes you so special that God decided to choose you?”
“I’m nothing special honestly. I have a little training in weapons, study philosophy and natural philosophy in my spare time, and work as a farm attendant to make money for my family.”
“Such a humble upbringing for such a big responsibility.”
“God usually does do that. Jesus was born in a manger and worked as a carpenter and yet, He’s the most important person in human history.”
“Then someone like me can be important as well. I came from a poor family with my dad working as a cleaner and my mother even working as a housemaid for our neighbors. I got interested in natural philosophy in my teenage years, went and graduated college, and moved here to further human knowledge of the known world. Maybe God has a purpose for me since I’m still alive.”
“I’m sure He does. He has a plan for everyone.”
“Indeed.”
He’s really smiling right now as if a ray of sunshine is shining in his heart. I hope this is a good sign of the change of his worldview.
We’ve arrived at the place where the final piece of Adam is and I’m back at the church Magdalene is from. There doesn’t appear to be anyone here, so it seems like the last people here died or changed. As we approach the large building, the church bells in the city ring in unison. The blood and bodies from the city start to gravitate towards the top of the church and mesh together into one atrocity that’s a mess of dead and decayed bodies with one creature at the top that appears to be controlling the rest. It crushes the entire church when it full forms and lets out a yell that sounds like all of hell is howling.
“It wouldn’t be worth it if it wasn’t insanely difficult to get,” I say.”
“What the bloody hell are we going to do?!” Bradford frantically says as we try to fight the many creatures on the atrocity.
“Cutting, smashing, and shooting always worked for us.”
“I don’t think it’s going to work this time.”
“Probably.”
I see holy water and several rosaries that have come from the destroyed church. I run towards them and pour holy water on my weapons and wrap them in rosaries. Maybe a prayer or two will make this plan of mine work.
“I don’t think Hail Marys and Our Fathers will help us much in this situation Ashton!” Bradford says as he fends off the many creatures who are getting the most of him.
“Will you let go and give me control?” an echoing voice says.
“I do my lord,” I respond.
I switch my scythe to an ax. Ready myself then run towards the beast and hold it as high as I can before bringing it down with every bit of strength that’s coursing through my veins. The blade slices higher than I expected and cuts the atrocity in half, which makes it rain blood on the entire city.
Bradford stares at me in amazement then says, “That blade was reaching the skies. God really was on your side.”
“I’ve been told that I’m blessed. I didn’t know I was this blessed.”
“You truly are a gift sent by God, Ashton.”
“Thank you for the compliment, but we must get the last piece of Adam before anything other crazy events happen.”
“Oh! Of course.”
Shifting through the wreckage of the church and the atrocity, Bradford finds the head of Adam.
“This is it, Ashton! We’ve done it! Come now, we should get back to my lab as fast as possible.”
Is this going to be the end? It feels like it and I hope it is. Despite my importance in what happened here, I won’t lie when I say that I miss my normal life. I hope Bradford knows what he’s doing.
 
 
 
 
 

Chapter 7 – Unnatural
Our little group of people start a celebration at a bar across the street from the alchemist’s workplace as Bradford puts the pieces of Adam together. The blood moon appears to be setting and morning appears to be slowly but surely approaching. I’m not a big fan of alcohol so I let everyone else enjoy themselves in the bar.
“Hey, Ashton! We’ve found this bottle of rare Italian wine in the basement of the bar. We think that Bradford and you should have it,” one of the alchemists say.
“Thank you.”
“You should give some to Bradford right now. Maybe it’ll help him move faster.”
“Haha, right.”
Entering the alchemist’s workplace, I say, “Hey Bradford, the boys are giving us this rare bottle of Italian wine. Want to share it?  I’m not a drinking man so you can have most of it…Bradford? Are you too caught up in your work to be bothered? Respond to me in some way man.”
I wait for a response then go to where Bradford is supposed to be working. Once I open the door, I see what was keeping Bradford so occupied. He’s fused himself with the body of Adam and the demonic blood. He’s completely naked and his muscles are huge.
“Bradford! What the hell are you doing?!” I say as I take out my weapons.
“I am making the most out of creation,” Bradford says in an echoing voice, “With my body, people will be able to make a cure for any disease and fix any injury. Isn’t it glorious Ashton?”
“Bradford, you’re turning yourself into-”
“A beacon of hope, of healing, and of inspiration.”
“A monster!”
“…You must be mistaken. I’m still alive and stronger now than I ever was before. I know what is good and what is evil in the world. Who knows what is truly good and evil and does evil anyway?”
“The devil.”
“Then you must be the Archangel Michael. If I am truly at fault, then strike me down with your weapon that you got from God Himself!”
I run at him and the blade actually starts to cut through his skin.
“Impossible!” he says as he moves away, “That blade must cut through anything! It can’t cut through anything good and pure!”
“I think you’re mistaken.”
“Prove it then. Give me your blade. I’ll cut you, but I won’t kill you.”
“You expect me to trust you after what you’ve done?”
“I think I’m doing the right thing. Give me a chance or rather, have faith in God.”
What a time to test my faith. My intelligence in my head must’ve left me because I give Bradford my scythe. He uses it to cut me, but the blade just bounces off me while causing no pain.
“What?!” he says in disbelief.
Bradford then switches to the ax and that too bounces off me and I don’t feel a thing. I try to take the scythe back, but Bradford just pushes me through the door and out of the workplace. Bradford’s colleagues come to see what’s happening, but they are swiftly cut down by Bradford.
“This is a battle between Ashford and me!”
“What’s wrong with you Bradford?! You aren’t going to help anyone like this!”
“That’s where you’re wrong. This body holds the cure for every disease and injury.”
“Are you sure of that? You haven’t even tested that yet.”
“I believe in the legends. If they got me this far, they must be true.”
“You believe in a blind faith based on nothing but wishful thinking.”
“Shut your mouth!”
Bradford breaks my scythe into pieces but not without hurting himself. The bastard!
“Your weapon from God is broken and you have nothing left. Your pistol won’t help you kill me since your scythe was your most powerful weapon.”
What am I gonna do? I can try to run away, but he’ll eventually kill me.
“You’ve always been an instrument of God,” a voice in my head says.
“Of course,” I say aloud.
“What is it, Ashton? Have you come to the same conclusion I have?”
“No. I’ve always been the instrument of God’s will here. The weapon was just my aid.”
“You’re a fool.”
Bradford rushes at me as I feel a surge of power rushing through my body. I block his punches then give him one in the face that sends him crashing into a wall.
“Wha-What?!”
“This is the end of the nightmare here. And it ends with your death. I’m sorry Bradford.”
He yells at me as he sends a barrage of kicks and punches at me. None of which are very painful. Once he starts to tire, I grab his arms break them with a single twist.  I then break his legs by stomping on his knees. Each break makes him scream out like a beast in pain. As I stand over him, he looks at me with a sudden change in his face.
He says to me, “How long would it take for God to forgive me?”
“Quicker than an instant, my friend. If you’re honest.”
“…Thank you.”
With one single punch, I smash his face into the ground. The sun starts to rise, and the city starts to sink and simmer from the sun’s rays. I run for the exit and make it over the bridge, which is suddenly fully repaired. I’m fast enough to make it back to land to see the City of Sanguine sink into the abyss below the sea and watch the sea cover over where the island city once was. The bridge I crossed and even the island also collapses into the abyss to ensure that everything disappears. I take off the cloth on my heads as my vision blurs and look into the sea to see that I have my eyes again.
No one on earth, besides me, will know what happened here, but fame here doesn’t matter to me since it will eventually fade away. I’m sure God will reward me a different way later in my life. I hear a carriage coming from behind me and I turn around to see one.
The carriage driver says to me, “Are you, Ashton?”
“Yes, I am sir.”
“A wealthy man paid me to come pick you up here and drive you back home. He also told me to give you this large sum of money along with a new Bible. You must have friends in high places, don’t you?”
I smile and say, “I do. And I’m thankful every moment of my life for them.”
I’ll be telling my relatives stories about what happened here. Sure, they’ll never know that the story is nonfiction, but I hope they learn the lessons taken from it. I feel like I can do almost anything now. There’s this beautiful lady I know back home. We usually exchange small talk and smiles every day. I know she’s single so I’m going to take my chances with her. Being a father sounds like a great idea as well. Maybe I’ll even go to college and become a teacher. The possibilities are endless for me. They’ve always been.

Adventure 1 – Living in a Tough World
There’s a small town that not many go to, but many people make legends of this place. The town’s name is Inanis. Legendary people are said to come from here along with the origins of certain urban legends and folklore. Ricky is the only rat in the world with red and blue eyes and he and his family and friends live in the city as it goes through rough times. Few know why Ricky has red and blue eyes, but it appears he has a connection to The Caretaker or The Light that no other being in this town has.
He’s been playing with his friends on the outskirts of town. They’ve been playing tag and hide and go seek with each other until several human pass through the area they’re playing in. They hide in the trees as they pass.
His friend Jasper says, “These humans are a nuisance.”
Jasper’s brother, Jett says, “We should find a way to be rid of them. They seem to get sick when we’re around them, so let’s run around their houses and touch everything that’s theirs.”
“We shouldn’t bother them,” Ricky says, “They’re just trying to survive and live a good life like us.”
“You’re right Ricky, but it doesn’t mean we shouldn’t make them know that they’re bothering us.”
“How could they understand us?” Becky says, “They can’t even understand our words.”
“They’re such illiterates.”
“Never mind them for now. Let’s just get back to playing.”
“Wait, did you hear that?” Ricky says as a noise catches his ears.
A noise that sounds like a horse running through the forest. Ricky sees a dark shadow in the distance with yellow eyes. As it comes closer he sees that it’s the Rat of Decay, a legendary rat that comes to towns that are filled with filth and lack good people. It spreads the plague and is known to be weak to fire.
“We have to stop it! It’s the Rat of Decay!” Ricky says as he climbs down from the tree to get rocks and other things to light sticks on fire.
“Why should we? If that rat gets rid of the humans here, then we can own this town.”
“Then who would feed us? If the humans go, then our source of food goes too. It’s not like you can farm like they can. Give me a hand here Becky.”
“Already with you.”
The pack of rats use the sticks of fire as weapons and stick them in the Rat of Decay. Some hit the monster while others are swiped away, which catches the forest on fire. With one last fire stick, Ricky runs towards the rat and sticks in the monster to burn it to ashes. Though the monster burns to nothing, it can and will reappear if the circumstances are right. The fires in the forest attract the attention of the people in the town who rush to put it out. Ricky and his friends scurry away as the forest comes down around them. A branch lands on Becky and Ricky stops in his track to save her.
“Don’t worry about me Ricky and save yourself!” Becky says as she tries to push him away.
“No! I’m not letting you die this way. We still have to get married and have children later!”
“If that’s what you want, then you should ask the other girls! They’d love to be with someone like you!”
“You’re wrong Becky. You’re the only one for me!”
The branch is slightly lifted up by an unseen force and Ricky carries Becky out of the burning branch and out of the forest.
“That was amazing Ricky!”
“That was more like a miracle.”
“The Caretaker does look after you more than any other rat I know.”
“I think the best thing he gave me was you.”
“Can you get us to safety before you start smooth talking me?”
Once the group of friends get home, they explain the situation to their elders. They’re happy that Ricky chose the right decision and throw a small party for him. Ricky is usually celebrated for his deeds of bravery. It’s what got him his red and blue eyes in the first place. He recounts the tale of how he got it to his pack of rats.
“It was a grey and awful day. I was starving to find food for us when I noticed a baby in the mud near a crashed carriage and it appeared that the parents perished in the accident. I ignored the baby at first, but I found a blanket and toy in the carriage and give them to it. After a few moments, it calmed down in time for a pack of human bandits to find us. It appeared that they were the reason the carriage crashed and why the baby was orphaned. I had the opportunity to run away, but I didn’t because I knew I had to do the right thing even if I died. As I attacked one of them head on, they stabbed their pointy sword through my eye and my entire body. That’s when the Caretaker hit me with a bolt of lightning and saved my life. He blinded the bandits both literally and figuratively because even they could sense his presence. The baby crawled over to me, pet me on the head, then ascended into the heavens. That is the story as to how I got these eyes and abilities.”
Everyone claps for him and cheers for Ricky. Ricky is a rat that goes on adventures in dangerous places to help people and his pack of rats. This is only the first of many that will happen in the town of Inanis. An empty, dirty, and depraved town that’s a perfect place for vermin of all kinds. A place of legends and of nightmares.
 

Adventure 2 – Both Beauty and Beast
A woman is known to wonder the world asking people if they think she’s pretty. She wears a mask around her mouth, but she has pretty black hair, shining brown eyes, and a decent dress. No matter what you answered, she would take the mask off from her mouth to reveal her shark-like teeth then ask you again if you thought she was pretty. If you said yes with a convincing tone of voice and expression, then she would leave you alone. If you couldn’t do this or said no, she would take your face off your head without ripping it off and you would suffocate to death because you couldn’t breathe. If you were female, she would take your appearance and your body would look like her previous victim. The woman was originally a princess who was rejected by every single prince in the land, so she sold her soul to The Inverted Light and goes around stealing other people’s beauty and getting rid of those who don’t like how she looks. Her real name is lost to time, so people call her the Princess of Many Faces.
Rumors have been circulating of this woman being in Inanis and Ricky is on the lookout for her even though she isn’t known to harm animals of any kind. His friend Jasper joins him.
As Jasper eats some grapes they found, he says, “Do you really think you can get rid that freaky princess, Ricky?”
“I’ll try to get rid of her from this town at least.”
“What’s your plan?”
“I’m still thinking of that.”
“Great.”
“Wait. I see a woman who could be her.”
“You do?”
Ricky points to a woman walking the streets.
“I’m going to go after her.”
“What if he’s just a woman wear a mask because she doesn’t like the smell of the town? Maybe we should wait until she does something?”
“We have to take a chance before she takes another life.”
Without a second thought, Ricky rushes down to the woman, runs up her body, then removes her mask. She isn’t the princess he seeks. The woman smacks Ricky off her face and runs away.
Jasper rejoins him and tells him that, “You aren’t going to find that woman like this.”
“Then what do you suggest we do?”
“Keep an ear out for a woman asking if they think she’s pretty. You know it takes longer than a few seconds for that beast to attack.”
“But that could happen anywhere in the town! We could be late…”
“Huh. Do you hear that?”
“Oh no.”
Jasper and Ricky run around the corner to find the woman who Ricky demasked now faceless and suffocating. Ricky tries to cut out a hole in her face to help her breath, but all he does is scrape her face.
A voice above him hands him a cloth then tells him, “Put this cloth over her face.”
Ricky takes the cloth and puts it over the woman’s face. After a few seconds, she gets up with her face back to how it used to be. She gasps for air then looks around for her savior. For some reason, she realizes it’s Ricky, so she picks him and thanks him.
“Thank you so much for saving me! I had no idea that a rat like you would save me,” she says.
“You’re welcome,” Ricky responds.
“What?! I can understand you!”
“You can? Well if that’s the case, can you tell me where that woman who stole your face went?”
“I don’t know, I’m sorry. Once she took my face, my vision went completely black.”
“Oh, well I’m sorry you had to go through that.  I’m going to catch her and drive her out of town.”
“Let me help you.”
“Thank you. What’s your name?”
“Pepper.”
“Thank you, Pepper. You’re saving lives by helping us.”
“No, thank you. If you hadn’t been here, I would’ve died. I’ll carry this cloth with me as a good luck charm.”
Both Jasper and Ricky travel on Pepper’s shoulders while looking around for the woman with Pepper’s face.
“You’re lucky you have the Caretaker on your side Pepper,” Ricky says.
“Who’s that?”
“You don’t know who the Caretaker is? The Light?” says Jasper.
“Oh, I know who you’re talking about now. You’re a special rat, aren’t you Ricky? Are there more like you?”
“None that I know of.”
“It’s a shame that a rat has to do what a more capable human should. No offense.”
“Hey, you would’ve been dead in the streets if it weren’t for Ricky.”
“It’s okay Jasper. No offense taken Pepper.”
“Why aren’t there more people out today?”
“What? You aren’t from these parts?”
“No, I’m a traveler who wanted to see this town to see if I can find an urban legend.”
“A lot of humans get into trouble when they come here for that reason.”
“Yeah, you should leave town for your own safety.”
“I will once I help you two out.”
Pepper and the two rats travel through the town until the find someone who looks like she has Pepper’s face. She’s turned around, but Ricky urges Pepper to check her out anyway, but once she turns around, the woman is revealed to not look like Pepper. It’s only their hairstyles that are similar.
“I’m sorry miss.”
“Uh, it’s-Oh! You have rats on your shoulders!”
“It’s fine. They’re harmless and friendly.”
Ricky smiles and friendly waves to the woman.
“Uh…hi there.”
“Be on the lookout for a woman with a mask on her mouth. She’ll steal your face.”
“I heard of that legend roaming the streets. Thank you for the warning. I’ll be heading home now.”
“Be safe!”
After patrolling the town for a bit longer, Pepper sees the princess they’re looking for as the turn a corner.
Pepper quickly steps back and hides then says, “That’s her! What should we do?”
“We’ll use the cloth that gave you back your face,” Ricky says, “If it can give you back your face, it should give the princess back her original face.”
Jasper asks, “And that will get rid of her how exactly?”
“I don’t know, but it should do something.”
“I’ll try to help…in some way. She already has my face, so I don’t think she can do anything else to me,” Pepper says.
“Alright. We should move before she gets away. Come on!”
Ricky and Jasper sprint towards the princess. She knows their intentions because of the Inverted Light and she takes off her the faces she’s obtained and throws them at them. Each one of them screams and home in on Ricky or Jasper with their mouths wide open. Pepper grabs a nearby sharp two-by-four piece of wood and protects her rat friends with it.
“You took my face you witch! You aren’t going to harm anyone ever again!”
Pepper then breaks her weapon over the head of the princess, which allows Ricky and Jasper to put the cloth over the princess’s face. The princess tries to get it off, but Ricky and Jasper keep it on her face until she stops struggling. Once they take off the cloth, her face goes back to the one she originally had. Her face along with her body turn to dust soon after.
“Thank you for helping us Pepper,” Ricky says, “We wouldn’t have been able to do this without you.”
“No, thank you. This was a great adventure for me despite almost dying.”
“I guess this is goodbye. I hope I’ll see you later.”
“Me too, but first, tell me if you know this. Do rats and other animals go to Heaven?”
“We have souls like humans, so we do in a way.”
“Ok then. I hope to see you again!”
“Me too! See Jasper? Some humans aren’t so bad.”
“I guess not.”
 

Adventure 3 – Don’t Talk to Strangers
No matter where you are, there are legends of spirit hitchhikers. Some legends end in death while others end in the disappearance of people. There are many stories that surround certain ghosts. Some spirits search for revenge, some are demons masquerading as weak people, and others are looking for closure. Because there are rumors of dangerous spirits, Ricky and his friend, Jett, are going to get rid of these spirits with a book of exorcist prayers and commands.
While searching for spirits, Jett asks Ricky, “Do you think we might find any animal spirits? What about rat spirits?”
“We already encountered the Rat of Decay two days ago, so it wouldn’t surprise me?”
“When are you going to marry Becky?”
“What kind of question is that?”
“A normal one.”
“I’ll marry her when I get a little older. We’re still young rats.”
“Can you tell me what Jasper and you did yesterday? He didn’t tell me much.”
“We got rid of the Princess of Many Faces and saved a human named Pepper yesterday.”
“That’s probably why he didn’t say much. I don’t blame him. Was she a pretty human woman?”
“I guess so.  Why is that even a concern for you?”
“I could’ve told Becky what you said.”
“I’d toss you in the trash.”
“Really? I thought you were supposed to be merciful.”
“You’re a rat. It shouldn’t bother you.”
“Why did you even bring me along?”
“If seeing a human in a positive light can change your brother, it can probably change you.”
A spirit appears before the two rats along the road and asks them, “Can either of you lead me home?”
“I can,” Ricky says before saying a prayer that sends the spirit to where they’re supposed to go.
“You know your plan isn’t going to work if we can’t find a spirit who’s gonna-”
Jett is interrupted by the sounds of a carriage and horse going out of control in the forest. The two rush to find a horse being pulled into a small well with a crashed carriage. A pastor is patching up what appears to be a prisoner who suffered injuries from the crash. The bones of the horse fly out after it somehow fit into the small well and half a person comes crawling out of it. Both Ricky and the pastor chant exorcist prayers, which makes the spirit burn to ashes, which disappear into the air.
The pastor looks down at Ricky and says, “Never in my years did I think I would see an exorcist rat.”
“I never thought I’d see a horse fit into a well like that.”
“And you can talk too. What is your name, my little friend?”
“Ricky. What is yours father?”
“My name is Father Urien. What are you and your friend doing here at this time of day?”
“I’m trying to protect the people of Inanis and teach my friend how good humans can be.”
“That is very interesting. You have to be a miracle from Heaven above. I’m here to take this man to a convent here in town. He’s trying to repent for all the things he’s done in life.”
“He looks like a prisoner,” Jett says.
“This man escaped from prison months ago.”
“Shouldn’t you turn him into the authorities for punishment for his crimes?”
“He’s already been punished by the One whose name is above all others and now he wants to make up for his mistakes. The Royals do not have power over Him.”
“That’s true. I thought humans made the royals to have power over Him, but I see that there’s some don’t see it that way,” Jett says as his respect for the humans grows.
“Thank you for opening your eyes to that. Can you help me get my friend over to the convent? I’ll be sure to reward you.”
“Of course,” Ricky says.
Father Urien helps the criminal walk as Ricky and Jett travel alongside them. Since rats have a better sense of spirits than humans do, the two lead them in a direction that allows them to avoid any hostile spirits.
“Tell me human,” Jett says to the criminal, “What did you do to be sent to jail?”
“My name is Ziv and my deeds are too horrifying to speak of. Let’s just say I have more bodies than a cemetery and stole more than a tax collector. After escaping prison, I thought I could just relax until I died, but visions and demons kept clawing at my soul until I couldn’t take it anymore. I met Father Urien after that and this is how I got to where I am now.”
“And now you think you can be saved after all you’ve done?”
Father Urien says, “It’s how grace works. I too was in a similar situation to this man’s and obtained redemption.”
“If you say so.”
They make it to the edge of Inanis, but a small group of spirits and demons prevents them from leaving the forest.
“We’re going to clear a path for Ziv then we’ll take care of these dark spirits,” Father Urien says to Ricky.
“Right.”
“What are you talking about father? I won’t just leave you,” Ziv says.
“You’ll have to. They sense the darkness within your soul and they’ll use it against us all, so you have to escape.”
“You should go too, Jett. It’s not safe for you here.”
“Tch. If you say so,” both Jett and Ziv seem to say at the same time.
Father Urien takes out a dagger and sword from his robe. Both have marks of the Caretaker on them and seem to shine in an unusual way despite the lack of sunlight in the sky.
“I used to be a knight in the royal army, so I’m no stranger to combat. Let’s go.”
Ricky and Father Urien clear a path for both of their friends with their prayers and strength until their friends are able to safely leave the forest.
“Are you okay father?” Ricky asks as he notices the scratches on Father Urien’s body and face.
“Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I shall fear no evil. For thou art with me.”
“Father!” Ziv screams as he runs back with Jett on his shoulders.
“What are you doing Ziv?!”
The spirits fly over Ricky and Father Urien and encircle Ziv and Jett. They whisper in his ears to go back to his violent ways and get rid of Father Urien.
“Don’t listen to them, Ziv! Do what I told you!” Jett says.
“I’m not sure if it’ll work now!”
“You have to have a little faith!”
“I…I will! Begone spirits! My soul doesn’t belong to you!”
A light emanates from Ziv’s body which dispels the spirits around him. Both Ricky and Father Urien ask their friends if they’re okay.
Ziv and Jett smile at each other before looking at their friends and telling them that, “We’re better than okay.”
“Ziv, I can see that your soul is ready to accept redemption.”
“Thank you, father, but I’m sure I still have much to do.”
“Of course. This process of living a good and honest life is never easy or simple.”
“But I’m sure it’ll be worth it. Thank you, Ricky and Jett, for helping us.”
“There’s no thanks necessary. We’re happy to help,” Ricky says.
“Is it okay if I see you again Ziv?” Jett asks.
“It goes without saying. You two can come visit us anytime you like.”
After saying goodbye to their new friends, Ricky asks, “I’m surprised you made a new friend. A human friend on top of that.”
“I’m surprised too. They’re not all that bad. Even the criminal ones.”
 

Adventure 4 – Here There be Monsters
There are dozens of rumors of sea and lake monsters. Some of the legends tell of creatures that match the description of beasts of old, others tell about wildlife that are abnormal versions of existing animals, and the last kinds are beyond imagination. Most of these monsters are dangerous to humans only when they bother them. The one Ricky is going after is a lake monster that killed his grandfather and grandmother who were fishing in the lake. He has put their untimely passing behind him, but his parents haven’t so they join him. They bring bait, sharp knives, and other things to draw out the creature of the lake. They have to take quite the hike to make it to the lake where the creature is supposed to be, so Ricky and his parents hop on a merchant’s carriage that is going in that direction.
Ricky says to his parents, “This is going to be really dangerous mom and dad. Be careful.”
His dad, Apollo, says, “Look who’s being the parent. You don’t have to worry about us son.”
“We can handle ourselves. Just because we’re old, it doesn’t mean we’re weak,” his mom, Daphne says.
“I know. I’m just saying because I care.”
“Listen to our son, Apollo. He’s growing up to sound like a parent already.”
“At least he cares about us unlike other young rats his ages.”
“Well you know the saying the humans have, ‘Every son is a knight to his mother who is his queen. His father is king, and his love is his princess. His love will become his queen once he marries her and gives her children and the cycle goes on’.”
“Well he certainly is our little knight.”
“We’re here mom and dad.”
The rats get off the carriage and make their way up to where the lake monster resides.
“Tell me Ricky, when are you going to marry Becky?” Daphne asks.
“What? I don’t know. Why? Do you want grandchildren that badly?”
“No, we’re just wondering. You’ve been together for years and I know you have a ring somewhere in your room.”
“I-I don’t have a ring for yet. I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
“You can impress her at the sports event coming up soon. I’ll be making the winner’s wreath again. Did I ever tell you how I met your mother?”
“You told me many times.”
“Well, I met her in a beautiful tree with pink flowers as leaves. It’s as if she were like the doves in the sky.”
“And your father always exaggerates our meeting.”
“He even made a painting of it with paint he stole from an artist’s house.”
“We still have it hanging in our room, so you must still like it.”
“Of course I do.”
“Hey, mom and dad. We’re here.”
Ricky and his parents set up their fishing equipment and have their weapons ready. They set themselves up in the same way Ricky’s grandparents were. To draw out the creature, they send their bait to the bottom of the river then wiggle the bait on what feels like a rock at the bottom of the lake. This makes a longnecked, snake-like monster emerge from the lake. It makes a loud roaring noise at the sky then focuses on Ricky and his parents. The rats attack the creature with sharp knives and sword, but their attacks barely affect the creature. Pores on the creature’s skin suck in Ricky and his parents who get sent to different parts of the creature’s body.
A light envelops Ricky’s body, which gives him a suit of rat knight armor, so he’s safe when he falls into the digestive stomach of the monster.
“Mom! Dad! Are you out there?!”
He can hear someone screaming something back, but he’s not sure if it’s his parents.
“Get out of here! I’ll take care of the rest.”
There’s silence this time. Ricky sees that he has a sword along with his armor. He walks around the stomach of the beast until he finds a tube that leads out of it.
“The heart has to be somewhere. This monster can’t be that big.”
Alas, Ricky finds himself walking through a maze in the monster’s body. It’s almost if the monster is designed from the inside to be a maze as the inside of the monster is vast and more open like a catacomb. There are skeletons of humans and other animals in the monster’s body that appear to very old. Among the skeletons, he finds a pair of rat skeletons with a couple trinkets on them. These trinkets are the ones that his grandma and grandfather.
“Grandma…Grandpop…I’ll be sure to avenge you and make sure this monster doesn’t hurt anyone else ever again!”
Ricky takes their trinkets as good luck charms. Suddenly, he’s attacked by goblins that act like the creature’s immune system against attackers. When Ricky slices them, they dissolve and split into two then two into three. Seeing that he can’t defeat them, he sprints towards the general direction he thinks the creature’s heart is. He hears a beating sound as he gets closer to it with the goblins hot on his tail, literally.
“I don’t have time to go through this maze of a body!”
As aggravation set in, Ricky cuts his way through the walls in the body until he cuts into the heart’s chamber. The heart is suspended by chains and worshipped by the goblins. Thinking on his feet, he scurries across the chains and cuts down the heart, which melts the monster from the inside out. Ricky quickly cuts his way out of the monster’s body while running for his life. Eventually, Ricky cuts his way the throat of the monster that lifts him up and out of the monster’s body as it uses its last breath to scream out at the sky again. With a sky view of the monster, Ricky can now see that the largeness of the monster’s insides makes sense now as its whole serpent body is a small mountain disguised by the forest.
“Wow, this view is-terrifying!”
To slow his descent, Ricky plunges his sword into the monster, which slows him considerably until he hits the ground and rolls down the monster and finally back onto solid ground.
“Mom?! Dad?! Oh no.”
Ricky cuts into the monster’s dead body to get to his parents, but they end up cutting themselves out not too far from him. He quickly runs to them and embraces them.
“Mom, dad! You’re okay!”
“We’re a bit bruised and cut, but we’re okay. What’s more important is that you’re okay,” Apollo says while holding his wife to help her stand.
“I found grandma and grandpop’s trinkets. Here.”
“Ricky…you found these in the monster?” Daphne asks.
“I found them near two rat skeletons. They died holding each other.”
His parents take a second to mourn but then smile.
“I’m sure they died happily,” Apollo says, “They’re probably smiling down from Heaven on their little boy who took down this giant monster.”
“How did you two survive?”
“We used our knives to slow our descent in the monster and wandered its body until we felt it dying. That’s when we started to cut our way out.”
“It’s a miracle you two survived.”
“It’s a miracle we all survived. Now let’s go home. I don’t think either your mother or I can handle another adventure like this.”
The family laughs before they go home where they tell the rest of the pack what happened and celebrate Ricky and his parents’ victory. The trinkets of Ricky’s grandparents are placed in a special part of their hideout where they keep treasured items that they honor from rats who were remarkable.
 

Adventure 5 – A Mad Dead Man’s Wonderland
You should never wander too far into the unknown otherwise you will lose your way back home and you’ll be lost forever. Because of the nature of Inanis, a wicked witch cursed the town, but she wasn’t able to do so before being burned at the stake. Instead, the witch secretly made another curse with an unknown effect. The place where the witch performed her experiments was destroyed and a hole full of valuable gold was found beneath the house. People from the town mined the seemingly infinite amounts of gold until the hole lead them to an unknown dimension. Few came back and told tales of a mysterious and even horrifying place full of strange beings and magic.
Ricky and Becky go to where the hole in and travel down it.
As they go down the hole, Ricky says, “Are you sure you want to do this? I can do this on my own.”
“You’ve said that so many times already and I’m not changing my answer. Everyone else has already gone on dangerous adventures with you. Now, it’s my turn.”
“Okay, but I’m just warning you.”
“I can handle myself.”
“Unless you need me to save you…again.”
“Hey, don’t act like you don’t like being the hero saving the girl.”
“Hey, don’t act like you don’t like being saved when I risk my life for you. I love you, Becky. I don’t want you getting hurt or worse.”
“You’re such a smooth talker, aren’t you?”
“I just say the truth.”
Eventually, they go so far down the hole that they end up on the other side of it. They end up in a magical kingdom with a clear blue sky, humongous plant life even for humans, and birds of many different breeds in the skies.
“This is beautiful,” Becky says.
“Yeah, but why is everything upside down?”
They look underneath their feet and see that they’re standing on the sky. This is when they fall down to the ground. Ricky holds onto Becky and covers her in a way so that he can take the effect of the fall. One of the humongous plants catches them and gently puts them down on the ground. It then bows to Becky.
“Uh…thank you,” Becky says to it.
Ricky looks up at the sky then says, “Where’s the hole that we came from? I can’t see it.”
Becky looks up.
“Me neither. I guess we’ll have to find another way out.”
Ricky holds Becky’s hand as he walks forward.
“I didn’t know you were so scared Ricky. I thought you were supposed to be the brave one.”
“I am. We just don’t know how this world works. I mean we stood on the sky and a plant caught us and saved our lives.”
“And you also just like holding my hand.”
“Ye-Yeah. That too.”
While traveling through the forest of exotic plants, they hear cackling. The cackling gets louder and louder until a head of a cat appears out of thin air.
He says to the couple, “Oh, rats have made their way into our kingdom, and one of them has red and blue eyes. That must mean you’re special.”
“We just came here to see what the fuss was about and why some people haven’t made it out of here,” Ricky says.
“Well why would you ever want to leave here? It’s such a wonderful place.”
“Are you keeping them somewhere?”
“No, they are keeping themselves here.”
“Tell me where they are then.”
“Why would I do that? You’ll leave after you find them. Enjoy yourselves while you’re here. Let me show you a few of my tricks.”
The hands of the cat appear out of thin air and they move around which makes the plants in the area dance and sing. Becky is amused by the serenade of the plants while Ricky is only slightly amused.
“How about this then for the gentleman?”
Women ladybugs, mice, and plant spirits come out to flirt and appease Ricky, but he holds firm to Becky’s hand.
“Thank you, ladies, but Becky is the only girl for me. I don’t need another.”
“How about this then?”
The cat holds Ricky with both of his hands then separates his lower half from his upper without killing him.
“What the?!”
Ricky’s legs start moving around as if it had a mind of its own and starts dancing. This is somewhat amusing to Becky, but part of her doesn’t feel right for some reason.
“Give me my legs back!”
“Ugh. Fine. You’re no fun.”
Ricky’s lower half attaches itself back to his upper as if nothing happened. He can also move around with no problems whatsoever.
“But now the two of you see the wonders of this place. Why won’t you stay for a while?”
“Thank you, but no thank you. Maybe we will next time.”
“There won’t be a next time and you know it. Maybe I should take you apart again.”
“Don’t touch me!”
When Ricky’s hand touches the cat’s, a light from Ricky’s hand slaps away the cat.
“You’re-you’re touched by Him!”
The cat and everything in the kingdom begin to melt as the light turns to darkness.
“We have to go Becky!” Ricky says as he pulls her along.
The two then sprint on all fours until they reach a rapid river. They see a boat with oars heading towards them, so they jump on it and take control as they head down the river. The river then turns black as the sky. Teeth fill its waters and doll hands start reaching up from it as if gasping for air. Sea serpents from the river that are black, doll faced, and filled with the souls of suffering people rage against the tide and the impending waterfall, which their boat falls down despite their best efforts to fight the tide.
A black bird with a doll face saves the couple and says, “S-s-save us.”
The doll faced bird takes the couple to the castle of the kingdom that is now laced with spikes. They land on the balcony of the castle with their boat and small bodies intact.
“Regretting coming with me yet Becky?”
“No, I’ll never regret being with you.”
The couple kiss before heading into the castle and confronting the queen of this kingdom, a magical witch who takes the form of her black cat. A light envelops Ricky to give him his knight armor and sword. This time he is also given a small knife.
The queen’s black cat knights attack Ricky. He swiftly uses his new weapon to frighten the cats with his fast movements before cutting at their legs, which bring them to heel. He does this to all of the knight till none stand and all bow to him.
“This is over,” Ricky says with his sword pointing at the witch queen, “Release the prisoners and I won’t have to send you to the afterlife.”
“Foolish rodent! You will do no such thing!”
The witch casts black magic on Ricky, which he struggles to fight against as it saps his strength. He tries slicing at it, but it has little effect since he can’t swing properly. Becky comes up from behind him and puts her hands on his shoulders.
“You can beat her Ricky! I believe in you!”
Becky’s encouragement allows Ricky to lift his sword up, which is now emanating a golden light. The light from the sword allows Ricky to send out a light wave from it that slices through the black magic, the witch, and the wall behind her. The witch turns to dust as the kingdom begins to implode from the inside. The bird from before and the other doll faced creatures take Ricky and Becky out of the castle and escape from everything that’s turning in on itself. Once everything in the kingdom is gone, it releases an explosion of energy that sends the couple and the captives through the hole they came in through and back into the normal world.
The hole is now gone, and the captives are back to their normal form as the witch’s magic is gone from them. They thank the rats then go their separate ways.
“So, what did you think of that, Becky? Do you still want to go on adventures with me?”
“Let me think about it-Of course I do! You would’ve died or worse if I wasn’t there to help you out.”
“I don’t know. I could’ve used the memory of everyone else I knew and you. Maybe that would’ve worked too.”
“Ricky!”
“I’m just kidding. I’m in your debt for helping me through my latest adventure.”
“That means you have to give me a massage and compliment me for the rest of the day.”
“What?”
“You said you’re in my debt and I’m already cashing in. Don’t make me give it more thought and make it worse for you.”
“Fine.”
“What? You have to compliment me.”
“Yes, princess. The love of my life.”
“That’s better.”
 

Adventure 6 – Hell’s Boy
There was an unfaithful nun who couldn’t keep her vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. As a result, she gave birth to a child with small demon horns. He cursed at the sky using swear words and other curses that witches and devil worshippers would know. The priests and nun present at the birth tried to exorcise the demon, but at least six of them are killed, including the nun who gave birth, before the child escaped. The demon child is rumored to live in deep within the forests of Inanis. It kills wildlife and humans for sport and food.
Ricky is accompanied by Becky again because of what happened the other day. Her parents and his parents encouraged her to go with him since they told their parents and the pack their experience. They bring weapons, a book of exorcism prayers, and other tools in case the demon child set traps as it is known to.
“Why did you even complain about me coming with you? You don’t want me here.”
“I always want you with me, Becky. Truthfully, I’m scared of something bad happening to you. This is why I say that you should stay at home with the pack where it’s safe.”
Becky hugs him.
“You don’t have to be afraid, Ricky. You’ll protect me, won’t you?”
“With my life.”
“Now don’t be too risky. You wouldn’t want to break my heart.”
“I won’t make any promises should the situation come up.”
“You’re such a cruel hero.”
“And a dedicated one at that for such a beautiful princess. Speaking of princesses, did you like that snow globe I gave you?”
“Of course I do. By the way, who’s the princess of calmness and patience?”
“She’s a princess in human myth and legend. A princess who had to stand on a sharp sword to save her kingdom. It’s said she stood on the sword for hours without even damaging her skin. She was a wise princess who never let her anger and emotions get to her even when things got dangerous and the villains were mocking her.”
“Her standing on the sword reminds me of the legend of the little mermaid. When she got feet, didn’t she feel like she was walking on knives?”
“I think so, but the princess I’m talking about is a bit happier of a tale.”
Sounds of rustling can be heard in the forest as if something is jumping across the branches.
“We should probably get ready now,” Ricky says as he begins to put his plans in motion.
He sets up traps for demon child then he and Becky begin to draw it out with prayers and shows of affections. This draws out the demon child who attacks the couple. Ricky and Becky quickly retaliate, which makes the demon fly into the trees. It’s still visible, so they chase it. It brings them through its traps, which include bear traps, nets, and holes with sharp sticks that are covered with branches. Ricky throws his knives at the demon and it cuts off its wings. It yells an unnatural scream in the air that makes the leaves on the trees around it die and fall off. With rage searing through its body, it chases Ricky and Becky. They lead it back to their trap that ensnares him in a small ball.
Father Urien meets up with them and says, “I’m surprised you two captured this demon, but then again, I shouldn’t be surprised by anything when it involves you, Ricky.”
Dead animals and walking corpses come out of the ground with a demonic look to them.
“It’s somehow taken control of them! Get out of here father. We’ll hold them off.”
“I’ll help by exorcising this child. It should get rid of the dead.”
Ricky and Becky use their many knives and leftover traps to hold off the dead. Even when they cut off their heads, the bodies of the dead keep moving. The only way to stop them is by cutting off all their limbs, but even then, their torsos keep wiggling around.
“Father! We’re in trouble here.”
“Keep them busy for a little longer!”
Becky begins to be overwhelmed by the dead, so Ricky rushes to her aid. The Ricky breaks his weapons while fighting the dead. All hope seems lost for the rats until Father Urien finishes the exorcism. The child goes back to a normal human being and smiles and giggles at Father Urien.
He smiles at the baby boy then says, “Thank you for all you’ve done,” to Ricky and Becky, “I’ll be taking the child to the orphanage. Hopefully, he’ll be adopted by a loving family.”
“It was good working with you again Father Urien. How’s Ziv doing?”
“Better than ever. The man might turn out to be a better priest than I.”
“Is that so?”
“It’s very much so. Your friends Jasper and Jett help him when they visit. I should get to caring for this little boy. I’m sure he’s tired after all he’s been through.”
“Okay, bye!”
“Bye-bye! Thank you,” the baby says.
“I’ll see you again my friend,” Father Urien says as he walks away.
“I didn’t know human babies can talk,” Becky says.
“They can, but human babies have to learn to speak the human language before they can be understood by other humans.”
“Oh, well speaking about babies. How many do you think we’re going to have?”
“How can I know? Why? How many do you want?”
“Maybe twenty or twenty-five.”
“Twenty or twenty-five?!”
“That’s the normal number.”
“No, the normal number is around twelve.”
“Well, I want twenty to twenty-five. Maybe more.”
“Why?”
“Because that’s what I want.”
“I guess I have to give the princess what she wants.”
“Princess? You mean queen.”
“Sure, I do.”
 

Adventure 7 – What Everyone Wonders About
Because of Ricky’s adventures, the Inverted Light as finally decided to take action against him. Because dozens of people in the town are wishing for an end to their suffering, he opens a fissure in the earth, which swallows the city at an alarming rate. The Reaper of Souls himself appears in the town to reap the souls of the people who try to escape, so none will escape this destruction. Ricky’s pack and his exorcist friends are fighting against the Reaper with swords and prayers alongside brave townsfolk.
As Ricky looks over the destruction he utters, “How am I going to fix this? I might be really over my head this time.”
The Caretaker stands by Ricky and points to the fissure and says, “Destroy the source in there and the hole will close.”
“I don’t know if I can do it.”
“You can. I’ll be with you as you go.”
Ricky is given his knight armor and weapons. He breathes in and out before heading to the fissure. Becky sees him and runs alongside him.
“Where are you going, Ricky?”
“I’m headed towards the fissure. The Caretaker told me that’s how I can stop all of this. This situation is more dangerous than the others. You should stay up here and help the others.”
“For the last time, I’m helping you no matter what the danger is.”
“I guess there’s no arguing with you on that.”
“You’re right about that. I’ll be with you no matter where you go.”
The couple travels down the fissure until they reach the bottom where they see a gray, demonic goat monster with six hands that’s splitting the earth alongside The Inverted Light.
Ricky unsheathes his weapons and points it at him and says, “The Abuser! I knew you had something to do with this!”
“You have no chance of winning against this towering foe, vermin. Tell your ‘Caretaker’ I send my regards,” the Abuser says before leaving through a portal.
“Coward! Becky, I still don’t know if we can handle this.”
“Be brave for the town! Be brave for the pack and our friends! Be brave for me.”
“…Okay. Let’s destroy this demon! For the town! For our loved ones! For the Caretaker!”
The towering goat monster smashes the ground in an attempt to crush the rats as they rush it, but their small size and nimble speed are too fast for them. They climb along its arm and cut it several hundred times. A death by a thousand cuts is their strategy for this demon that’s as tall and big as a house. The two take down one arm each as the demon tries to get them off it but can’t manage. Their strength and size might be small, but their size and speed make up for this. Another two arms fall and now the demon struggles to separate the layers of the earth that begin to crush it. Ricky and Becky cut the other two arms to weaken it, but not cut it off so they have time to escape. The earth begins to reattach itself and crush the demon while the Reaper has disappeared.
“Let’s get out of here Becky!”
“I’m right behind you!”
As the earth begins to come together, it’s obvious to Ricky that Becky can’t run fast enough, so he gets behind her and pushes her ahead. Ricky manages to push her out as they get to the surface, but the earth closes on him before he gets out.
“Ricky!”
Becky begins to claw at the earth to dig him up. A sword pierces through the ground and Ricky emerges from the ground. Becky hugs him once he stands up.
“I told you something like this would happen,” Ricky says, “I almost died there.”
“Thank the Caretaker you didn’t otherwise this would’ve ended up like Romeo and Juliet.”
“Don’t even think that way. We saved the town, but I’m sure they will be many more adventures.”
“And I’ll be with you through them all.”
Ricky and Becky share a kiss as the pack of rats and townspeople cheer in victory against evil. A victory won by two small rats who are small and weak, but brave and courageous.

Entry: 
Enjoy a video by our friend HistoryNet.
Parallels between the propaganda, talking points, etc. of New Atheism/Anti-theism today and back when militant Atheists had political power. Anti-theists think they can pretend that it wasn’t really Atheism to escape the guilt by association with those their shared anti-God ideology inspired. Apparently, it’s ok when they associate religion in general with its radicals (ignoring every good thing about it), so I’ll do the same.
In no way do I condone the fundamentalist extremism that helped give way to the New Atheist Movement, but there is no rational excuse for this disgusting, uncultured ideology that has helped ruin modern society as much as the holier-than-thou who want to impose their views as well. I think a far more practical solution is to use scripture to combat extremism; show them their errors. Love your enemy is important to remember. Also, Matthew 26:52 and Matthew 7:21 need to be kept in mind.

Title: The Little Dweeb School of Atheism
Author: OdaStOda

Category: Essays
Date: August 17, 2018
Entry: 
By Chris Ralph
In recent years, a branch of pop culture atheism has arisen which I call the “Little Dweeb” school. It is a follow on development out of the once popular “new atheists”, and like them is more of a pop culture phenomenon than something truly rooted in science or philosophy. This style of atheism does not bring anything new to the table as far as thought or principals, but is more of a new form or mode. Of course not all atheists fit this mold, but a very significant number do – especially of the many young men so enthusiastically enamored of the idea that there is no God. The absence of God does seem an odd idea to generate great quantities of enthusiasm, but has become a rallying point for many. One might ask what specific features characterize the “Little Dweeb” atheist. To further examine this, let us first look at what a dweeb is. The dictionary tells us a dweeb is a person regarded as socially dull, unsophisticated, foolish, inept, and awkward.
The vast majority of this class of atheist are young males who consider themselves far more intellectual and sophisticated than they actually are. They tend to make a number of claims that they simply cannot back up with evidence. Even claims that are not extraordinary in any way, they cannot demonstrate any support to them. When discussing with them things they say they know well, it will be commonly be discovered that they know little or nothing about these topics which they claim to comprehend accurately.
Many will claim to have carefully examined the religions of the world and found none of them to be true. However, if brought into a discussion of that nature of various world religions, they will be found to know little or nothing about them. Their knowledge level is that of someone who read two paragraphs an atheistic book which stated that all religions are primitive, superstitious and wrong.
They engage in rhetorical games such as the claim that they do not have a firm belief that God does not exist, they merely have a lack of faith that God exists. Well, a door knob also has a “lack of faith”, so they are claiming that on the extremely important question of the existence of a God, they are of one and the same mind as a door knob? They redefine words to strengthen their rhetorical positions – an example being that they redefine the word “faith” to mean an irrational belief that is held without any evidence or support. This is not what faith means. The simple consulting of a dictionary shoots down large parts of their rhetorical games. There are only so many versions of these rhetorical games that are typically employed and after one has heard them all several times, they become easily recognizable and very boring.
They will often use insults and arrogant condescension to avoid rather than engage in genuine discussion of the topic of God’s existence. They sometimes claim to be seeking answers, but when engaged, give all appearance of having no interest in any type of honest, meaningful discussion, only verbal jousting and insults. It is common that to justify their views, they will twist and revise the facts of history and other truthful, known conditions.
Believers who speak with them observing the normal bounds of polite conversation (and expect that they will also abide by those same respectful societal limitations) will be sorely disappointed. It is not unusual that where the believer brings reasonable arguments in support of God to bear upon these atheists, they will react poorly. In fact it’s not unusual that they may even threaten violence against the believer or his family.
They claim to be dedicated to science and express a belief that science has already or will eventually answer all questions of how all things came to exist – and prove that it was only through natural processes. They will say that they are very interested in science, that science produces the only valid truth. They hold science in such high esteem that in many ways they worship science in a matter akin to a religion, almost as if it were their god. However when engaged in a more detailed discussion about the specifics of science topics, you find they only grasp the most basic levels of introductory high school science. They would know more if they watched NOVA a couple times a month. The fact is that they have no great interest in learning about science, but have only an interest in using it as some type of excuse for their atheistic stance.
They hold the simplest form of a philosophical belief – a materialistic stance that only those things which can be seen, touched, measured or otherwise detected by equipment exist. At the same time they consider this simplest of viewpoints to be something very sophisticated and deep. This primitive and unsophisticated concept of reality is crucial to their world view. So admitting it or not, they will often take a nihilistic philosophical stance on truth, good, morals and knowledge. Morals are held to be nothing more than mere personal opinions, not something that is objective or true.
For those of you who have had discussions with young male atheists, you will find that a large percentage of them fit easily into the Little Dweeb mold. The bulk of the cry bully internet atheists trying to make a name for themselves belong to this “Little Dweeb” school.
One will wonder, if they are not terribly interested in science, and wield their atheism as a dodge or a hustle to put down others, why do they bother to adopt their atheistic stance? It’s not a result of any deep study of science or religion, no matter what they claim. The reason is clearly not the culmination of a long study and search for answers. What then is the point of it? I think a number of items of evidence point to the fact that the bottom line is an issue of morals. The Little Dweebs desire an excuse to do whatever they want whenever they want – to have full moral freedom to act as they will. As God has the authority as creator to establish absolute morals, the absence of God gives them latitude to establish whatever personal morals they wish.
Remembering that this is mostly a group of young men, one can guess that the main class of morals being objected to is any limitation on sex. Perhaps most of the Little Dweebs would prefer an actual female companion, but being inept at attracting any female, many settle for porn as a substitute. While most give no evidence of any notable knowledge of science, history or religion, I am convinced that if a porn IQ test were something that existed, they would score quite high.
The sex related morality hypothesis also explains some other important observations, one being the reason why the vast majority of the Little Dweebs are young males. It also explains the virulent objections of Little Dweeb atheists to Christianity. Many atheists with a more mature viewpoint, care not at all what others believe. They adopt a more libertarian view that so long as they are not forced to participate, all should be free to determine their own individual choices. However, for the Little Dweeb atheists in the matter of morals, if some people live a moral life and speak freely of it, this brings up guilt in those who choose atheism mostly to be free of objective morals. This is true even where the guilt is subconscious and the Little Dweebs themselves are not fully aware of it. It is in essence the Cain and Abel effect. Those who follow a moral path are intrinsically hated by those who seek to be free of objective religious morals and to live instead under their own subjective personal morals.
The Little Dweeb Atheists are a fad, and as such will pass in time. In the mean time, it’s worthwhile to be aware of what they are all about. The movement may morph into another form, but for now, it’s worthwhile to know how to speak with them. If you encounter them, it’s not really worth a lot of steam to get involved. Your time and effort would be better spent elsewhere in most cases. A true searcher is another story and it is well worth the time to engage them. While many Little Dweebs will claim they are searching, the truth is that the majority are not. Instead, their stance is a rock hard commitment of faith in atheism. They have not come to their stance as a result of any deep reasoning, so it’s unlikely that any level of sincere reasoning will bring them out of it.
Although most discussions with Little Dweebs will be utterly fruitless, sometimes the best and most honest discussions with them come not from discussions directly about God, but about morals instead. Since morals are the source of their problem with God, this line of discussion makes good sense. Try reasoning along a line going on from something like this: “If morals are nothing more than personal opinions, cultural conditioning or the result of genetic coding, why do we call men like Hitler evil? There is little doubt that Hitler believed his own actions were the correct thing to do, so do if there is no such thing as immoral behavior then you must agree with and support the rights of Hitler, Stalin, Radovan Karadžić and others to commit genocide. Are you a genocide supporter?” Even most who seek utter freedom from morals will admit in the end that evil exists. This line of thought just might allow you to move on to an honest discussion of the truth of good and evil in real and objective terms. Perhaps the discussion will eventually come around to the ultimate source of good and truth, the Lord God.

The United States has been in a state of Civil War since late December 2017. I don’t care what idiot says I’m crazy. That’s what happened and is happening. It went from Cold to Hot in December, among the Elites. On the streets it’s been skirmishes that we call “riots” or “unrest” or “just some Antifa and Alt-right douches.” At the higher levels, it’s been vicious economic warfare among Billionaires, huge actions between 3-letter agencies in the US and abroad, and hijinx between Nation State players, most of it spun or kept out of the press completely.
It will reach its apex PROBABLY in November 2018. If we Americans come acropper as a people, it will be by April 2019 at the latest I suspect.
Where we really are: likely Donald Trump is removed as President in the next year, 
OR, 
Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John McCain, George Bush, and their highest level supporters are declared disgraceful, and their highest level supporters (at least) go to jail. Including Attorneys General, FBI directors, CIA directors, and more.
No matter what, NOTHING will be the same going in to the 2020 elections, in the US or the world.
BTW as an NRA supporter I will be a Loyalist. Come and get me. I’m ready for you. I’ll be doing everything I can to help pro-Trump, anti-Globalist candidates wherever I can.
But I hope we all remember this song, and all its words. 
It’s a rare case of a Boomer Hedonist rocker getting every. single. word. correct.

Title: Truths that are hidden, but plain to see.
Author: Albert GimJuie Oon
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/07/29/truths-that-are-hidden-but-plain-to-see/
Category: Spirituality
Date: July 29, 2018
Entry: 
These are just thoughts I have to explain through reason alone why these beliefs I hold are true. I encourage you all to look at your beliefs and thoroughly examine them to make sure you’re living the right way that’s not only best for yourself but for the people you care about as well.

“Come now, and let us reason together, saith the Lord: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” Isaiah 1:18 (KJV)

It is self-evident that Christianity is true. Christianity itself focuses on rebirth, renewal, and redemption for the sake of love. Every day of our life we should be improving ourselves for the love of ourselves and others. We all make mistakes and do things every day to make up for things we haven’t done before. When we are older, we are hopefully wiser and a better person than we were before. By then, we should be completely different, but a better person. It makes sense then that the religion with the most historical and loving religion is the true one.

It is self-evident that Original Sin (in the Catholic sense) exists. When people make mistakes or do generally evil things, the people younger than them will usually suffer and have to make up for their mistakes. If a parent collects too much debt, their children will have to pay it off. If a government enacts certain laws or does something that damages the country, the youth will have to step up and take responsibility. What is done in the past always affects the present, so something as big as Original Sin would affect countless generations until it can be eventually removed through God’s grace.

It is self-evident that good and evil exists. Most actions will have a positive or negative effect on the person or people. If the action has an overall positive effect, then it is good and opposite if it is evil. It is good to work and stay active in order to make the most out of our lives. It is evil to take advantage of others and be lazy and waste our lives on vanity and temporary pleasures. The only actions that could be gray are personal opinion or if the actions have equally good and evil consequences. Someone’s favorite color, genre of book, music, game, and career choice are all personal opinions. If there is a scenario where two equally good lives are at risk and only one can be saved, then saving one person’s life is the best choice even though someone else’s life is lost. It would be best if both are saved, but in this event, the best scenario would be if at least one survives. This scenario is a bit uneven since a good action is still taken but I still think this can give you the right idea.

It is self-evident that the truth never changes. If it did, then the previous version of the truth would be a lie and this truth would be a lie as well because it contains similar elements of the previous truth. The truth would have to be unchanging and constant to be always true.

It is also self-evident that the truth is living. Living beings react differently to different situations and the truth does the same thing while staying constant. The truth has to be living in order to make all lies false. It can also be said that love is like the truth because it always stays true to its purpose.
It is self-evident that since love and truth are living that there is a being that embodies this. We call this God. It is self-evident then that God is the creator of the universe not because He had to, but because He loves. Love by its nature is meant to be shared with others to be enjoyed. This is why it should be also self-evident that God made everything out of love to share His love and because of this we can say that it is self-evident that God is all good.

It is self-evident that seemingly good actions can be evil ones. Saving a life is usually a good action, but if an individual saves a homicidal maniac for their own nefarious plans, then the action of saving a life becomes tainted.
It is self-evident that seemingly bad actions can be good ones. Killing someone is usually an evil act, but if someone kills an active child molester who never wants to change, then the act of killing has become an act of mercy for the potential victims and the molester so they cannot commit more disgusting acts.

It is self-evident that good will prevail in the end. Good people will help each other grow and prosper. Evil people will only look out for themselves and their own agenda while forsaking everyone else. Evil people also have a tendency to fight each other since they only care about themselves. Good people, on the other hand, will help each other understand the viewpoint of the other and put their minor differences aside for the greater good. Thus, because evil is self-destructive and good is pure and understanding, evil will be destroyed and good will prevail in the end.
It can then be inferred from here that good is eternal and evil is temporary. Since we’ve already established that God is good, then it can then be said with confidence that God is eternal. (This along with the previous self-evident truth about good and evil actions rules out the possibility of God committing evil actions)

It is self-evident that medicine and doctors don’t save lives, they only extend them. There has never been a case of a person living far beyond the normal life expectancy. New viruses and diseases will mutate and adapt to the medication and practices we invent to counter them. Because of that, every person on earth will die at some point no matter how far medical research goes.
This, however, is not to say that doctors shouldn’t stop extending lives since life is precious and beyond value.

It is self-evident that demons exist. There are many religions that have rituals and prayers to get rid of demons and possessed people. If a person is possessed, they will exhibit behaviors that psychiatrists can’t figure out. They will usually recommend a priest if their condition cannot be medically explained. Demonic possession has a long history and the cure to them is the work of a priest with the Vatican having the most experienced and famous exorcists. It is then evident that demons exist and if we’re talking about the most effective religion, then it would be Christianity and then Catholicism if we’re talking about the most effective version.
(It is then self-evident that God exists when using this example. If demons fear and bend to the power of God, then God must exist.)
It is self-evident that angels exist if demons exist. Demons are just fallen angels after all. Demons are fallen angels due to their similar abilities but angels will use them for good while demons will usually do evil and sometimes go against the will of God.

(Needs some work but good enough) It is self-evident that souls exist and that humans are more than flesh and bone. There are many cases of out of body experiences and paranormal research where humans will see the afterlife or be operating without a physical form. Human bodies can also be possessed by other spirits (such as demons as stated above), which implies that the human body is a tool that can be used by forces that don’t reside within it and aren’t visible to the human eye. It can then be reasoned from this that humans have souls and since souls can’t be possessed, souls are inferred to be the primary essence of a person.

It is self-evident that everyone lives with faith in their lives. You can never truly know how another person feels and thinks about you. You never know if the scientific and religious truths being taught to us are being taught by honest people who don’t have other motives or if they got part of their research wrong. You never know when the weather will go wrong and if you’ll be killed in the storm. It is then therefore obvious that we all have faith in people and reality so we do not live in constant fear and worry.

It is self-evident that the Church is a supernatural organization. Besides charity, the Church hands out eternal salvation to lost souls, truths about the spiritual, and the power to dictate morality given to it by God. It can exorcise demons, perform miracles, and act as a singular body that unites all of its members under one set of major beliefs (The United Body of Christ).

It is self-evident that God would’ve given supreme authority to an institution (which is the Church) when it comes to teachings and doctrines. A book or story can have many interpretations of it, which would and has lead to many sects/versions/denominations of Christianity. This is why the Church must have and teach the correct interpretation of the scriptures, history, and traditions. It must also be free from error thanks to God so that it will never lead God’s people astray.

It is self-evident that the Church would have scandals within it. A powerful organization such as this would have members who try to take advantage of what it offers and the influence it has on people. The holiness of the Church would be envied by others who would make up rumors and lies about it. Also, the Church would seem like an impossible organization to be a part of if it didn’t have members who are still susceptible to the temptations of sin.

It is self-evident that the Virgin Mary was eternally a virgin and born without Original Sin. Mary would’ve had to been born sinless thanks to the grace of God in order for Jesus to be the second Adam and the perfect sacrifice for our sins. The virgin birth is what also makes the birth of Jesus special and different to separate him from the rest of humanity.
It is self-evident from this example that Mary has special privilege and power, which is why she is called the Queen of Heaven and Saints. From this, we can say that it would be wise to pray to her with our intentions so that she can help us. To think that she isn’t special in any way or to think that she can’t help us is to insult her and you don’t want to insult a person’s mother especially since she is the Mother of God.

It is self-evident that the Church tries its best to mirror God in order to be what it’s supposed to be, which is the beautiful bride of Christ and/or the body of Christ where His followers reside. It can be reasoned that like God there is a singular head leading the Church. The Pope makes sense in this regard. It also makes sense because the Pope can only be infallible only when he is speaking from the seat of Peter, which allows him to be of one mind with God. Even though the Church can speak infallibly, only the head can institute new doctrines just like how God reveals truths that are new to us.

It is self-evident that the Christian denomination that doesn’t try to separate the Body of Christ (the Church) is the true version of Christianity. The mortal sin of schism separates people from the Body of Christ. It is used to create different denominations when a group of people is in disagreement with the Church. They make their own denomination and claim to be the true Church, but nothing good can be founded upon sin even if it’s done in the name of Christ. Since the Catholic Church has never committed a schism, it can be reasoned that the Catholic Church is the true version of Christianity.

It is self-evident that salvation can only be obtained through the true Church (which we have shown is the Catholic Church). It is this Church that God has tasked to teach and lead souls to salvation. God, Himself lives through the Church and is the supreme head of all of it since He leads it and instructs it. Because of this, a person must be in union with this Church to enjoy the fruits of eternal salvation.
This is not to say that a non-Catholic Christian or even non-Christians can’t be saved. Through the grace of God, if you die while saying a perfect contrition (repentance of sin based on a love of God rather than fear of Hell), then you will enter into eternal life after being cleansed. If you’re a non-Christian who wants to get baptized and enter into the Church, then the same will happen with you.

It is self-evident that people will live willfully ignorant lives because they are content with what they know. This is true for atheists who can have a good set of morals but refuse to learn more about the existence of God and don’t give Him the respect and honor He deserves. Thus, their actions aren’t morally good. This is also true of Christians who will choose what they think is true about Christianity and pick whatever version/denomination they feel comfortable with. These people don’t go all the way in learning about the truths that they need to know. If you can read this, then you have access to this information through the internet and can get it for free.
(It is known that this willful ignorance can damn a soul to Hell. It is then inferred that someone who has the opportunity to learn more but chooses to stay uninformed might be damned as well. I am, however, unsure if this is completely true and might just be judged on a case by case basis.)

Title: Anonymity and Secret Courts: Extraordinary Danger
Author: Diana Davison

Category: articles
Date: July 24, 2018
Entry: 
Please read “To Kill A Mockingbird.”
The role of the press in sexual assault cases is controversial. As we have seen since October of 2017, the Internet cannot get enough of sexual assault scandals and the #MeToo inquisition continues to claim names. Advocates for the rights of the accused are rightly concerned about the harm of unethical journalism in the court of public opinion and how easily a reputation can be ruined on the basis of unsubstantiated claims. As the recent Morgan Freeman fiasco has demonstrated, the press can be mobilized for slander campaigns on the basis of untested, anonymous complaints.
However, our society and our legal system, have shown increasing concern only about the potential negative implications of media attention for sexual assault complainants. In fact, in the Yukon, British Columbia, and Manitoba accusers are being offered anonymity prior to a formal criminal investigation, and sometimes in the absence of one. Their identity withheld, even from police. Although anonymous third-party reports won’t be sufficient alone for the police to make arrests, according to the Winnipeg Police Service sex crimes unit “having extra data handy could help them identify trends and serial predators.” In the same article, third-party reporting is further justified by the claim that it will provide more accurate statistics on sexual violence given that the crime is under-reported.
Third-party reporting will, without a doubt, result in an inflation of numbers. Uninvestigated claims of sexual assault are being treated as statistical data by the police to determine the scope of sexual violence in communities. Accusers are gaining the ability to report someone for sexual assault without identifying themselves and, more importantly, without possibility that their story will be scrutinized.
In BC, the process of third-party reporting begins with the alleged victim detailing the event to a member of a “community-based victim service program,” who acts as the third party. Without identifying the victim, the third party provides the police with a report of the event. From there, the police “evaluate the facts, start an investigation and take other actions that are appropriate, such as patrolling the area where the crime occurred.”
How can the police have the “facts” without knowing who the alleged victim is? Even if these reports may not result in charges against the accused, it is grossly unjust and irresponsible to create a database of sexual offenders on the basis of anonymous tips. There are no measures to prevent malicious allegations or collusion amongst accusers. We must conclude that the objective of third-party reporting is solely complaint solicitation, not the proper investigation of complaints.
The existence of a secret sex offender registry, where those registered are not aware of their inclusion and where inclusion is not based on even a direct police report, should cause outrage.
How has it gotten to the point where concern for protecting the identities of accusers of sexual assault has trumped concern for due process? The first step was to convince the public that the rights of complainants were indeed being threatened by allowing their names to be published. In the summer of 2015, the Canadian Victims Bill of Rights was enacted with the aim of protecting the dignity of victims of crime. The bill gives victims of sexual assault the special right to request a publication ban on their identity. According to the Department of Justice, publication bans “allow victims, witnesses, and others to participate in the justice system without suffering negative consequences.” More specifically, publication bans are intended to protect the “vulnerable,” such as children or minors, and to encourage testimony from those who might be otherwise deterred from participating in the justice system.
Sections 486.4 and 486.5 of the Criminal Code list other considerations in determining whether a publication ban will be granted, namely how it will limit the freedom of expression of others and how it will impact the right of the accused to a fair, public trial. Freedom of expression, in this context, applies particularly to the press and their ability to obtain access to the proceedings of the courts. The transparency of the courts, often called the open court principle, is a necessity for establishing trust in the legal system. Without openness, the public does not see how law is being practiced and, therefore, cannot determine whether it is being applied justly. No one thinks the courts should operate solely behind closed doors out of the public eye, but many are certainly privileging the interests of sexual assault complainants when these interests conflict with the public’s interest in open justice.
In 2013, York University law professor Jamie Cameron authored a very detailed report for the Department of Justice which shows how victims’ privacy rights, a relatively new concept, came into existence. As Cameron explains, having open courts matters because “a free flow of information encourages feedback and debate among members of the public, thereby promoting the accountability of institutions which exercise coercive powers against individuals.” This public value is protected by Section 2(b) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantees the freedom of expression and opinion of the public and the press. However, this freedom, like all constitutional freedoms, is subject to limitation by Section 1 if the limitation is “demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.”
It is important to remember that publication bans are not always implemented for the benefit of the complainant. Sometimes the accused is a minor, and so their identity is concealed. There are also cases where protecting the presumption of innocence may necessitate a ban, not on the accused’s identity but on a piece of evidence. A publication ban may be ordered at a bail or preliminary hearing to ensure that the public, media and, sometimes, potential jurors will not be exposed to inadmissible evidence that may cause bias against the accused. Clearly, a limit placed on the freedom of the press in this case would be reasonable. It is less obvious, however, that publication bans on the identities of complainants can similarly be justified. The publication of inadmissible evidence heard in a preliminary hearing will always compromise the fairness of a trial, whereas the identities of both parties involved will always be relevant facts in the case.
According to Cameron, there is no specific section of the Charter that grounds a complainant’s right to privacy. Instead, this right was born out of a conjunction of freedoms: Section 7’s promise of “the right to life, liberty and security of the person” and Section 15’s guarantee of equality “before and under the law.” After analyzing the case law which has shaped the rights of victims in sexual assault cases, Cameron concludes that complainants “are granted preferential or special treatment by the system” over complainants of other crimes, where anonymity is the rare exception rather than the norm. She poses the question of whether sexual assault is so unique a crime that it warrants “distinctive rules.” Given that the rights of complainants, defendants, and the press can all be constrained by “reasonable limits,” we should also be wondering how to determine, when these rights conflict, which party’s rights can most justifiably be limited.
Open courts and freedom of the press are fundamental components of a free society. Individuals within the criminal justice system (i.e. judges) are given significant power over others, making transparency a necessary check on judicial activism. The press and the public must have access to proceedings of the court to prevent arbitrary rulings from determining what constitutes justice rather than public dialogue and debate.
Press freedom should be limited with respect to court activity if, and only if, the alternative would pose an evident threat to the integrity of the criminal justice process. In the earlier example of a potential juror reading a media piece containing inadmissible evidence, a publication ban on the hearing where this evidence was first heard is justified on the grounds that it protects the fairness of the trial and encourages journalistic responsibility.
Certainly, the right of the accused to a fair trial is of paramount importance because it is their reputation and their freedom that is at stake in the process. They are up against the resources of the state, which are being mobilized to try to prove their guilt. No matter how traumatizing the court process is for complainants, throughout the trial it is only the accused whose freedom is at stake.
The privacy rights of complainants is a more complicated matter. A complainant is entitled to the same dignity and respect as the accused, but it is not blatantly clear that privacy is a necessary component of preserving dignity. A common justification for publication bans on the identities of sexual assault complainants is the stigma associated with being assaulted. According to Marco Chown Oved, investigative journalist for The Star, “[h]ardly anyone would be ashamed of reporting their car stolen, but admitting you’ve been raped has led, in other countries, to forced marriage with your aggressor or even honour killings by relatives. Those attitudes are present in Canada as well.” In the wake of the overwhelming support for the #MeToo movement, however, this argument is becoming increasingly untenable. As a culture, we do not condemn those who bring forward allegations of sexual assault. We applaud them and take immediate action against those accused, especially when those accused hold positions of power and influence.
Which is more stigmatizing – being presented to the public as the alleged victim of sexual violence or as the alleged perpetrator? If stigma was a sufficient justification for anonymity in sexual assault cases, it would provide a stronger case for a publication ban on the name of the accused. Of course, when a complainant makes an accusation there is no guarantee that they will receive only positive media attention. As we have seen with the Jian Ghomeshi trial, for example, coverage of a public trial can result in critical analysis of complainant testimony. There is a very real possibility that complainants will have their credibility publicly doubted and the details of their account scrutinized. But this is the way it should be, and the way it must be. Incentivizing women to bring allegations into the criminal justice system in higher volume cannot be the objective of sexual assault legislation without proper care towards the quality of the claims before charges are laid.
The fact is that no one exits the system feeling better. Trials are taxing physically and emotionally, for both complainant and defendant. We do not want to disincentivize real victims of sexual assault from going to the police, but the onerousness of the system is a safeguard. Without the guarantee of anonymity, a greater number of frivolous or vexatious accusers would be weeded out. This would allow court resources to be focused on those cases where there was a great harm done to the complainant, and especially cases where the accused poses a legitimate public safety threat. It is not that publication bans should never be imposed, but rather that they should not be granted to sexual assault complainants automatically by virtue of being a complainant. Publication bans should be exceptions to the rule of open court, being justified only when there is a demonstrable risk of safety to the complainant or when the case involves minors.
Of course, there is also the potential solution of offering both parties or only the defendant anonymity. Christie Blatchford, with her extensive experience covering sexual assault trials, has explored the idea herself when criticized for using the names of two accused men prior to a verdict. Blatchford thought that “it’s the allegations that do the soiling” of the reputations of those accused rather than the reporting of those allegations. However, she concluded that in hindsight she would have preferred not to have published their names.
The question of whether the accused has a right to have their identity concealed is emotionally charged. Given the current social predisposition to #BelieveWomen, few journalists hesitate to publish the name of anyone accused of sexual assault. In the court of public opinion there is no presumption of innocence. Numerous men and their families are living with the consequences of wrongful convictions and even those acquitted have no guarantee of normalcy in the aftermath of their trial. When the public is being coached to believe women unconditionally, how can they be expected to accept a “not guilty” verdict?
Because of the immense pressure put on judges to believe all complainants and convict, it is especially important right now to increase visibility for falsely accused people to ensure they received a fair trial. This is not an easy conclusion to accept because innocent people have been subjected to immense humiliation and hardship. Sexual assault trials put on display the sexual lives of both parties, with the court often hearing details of the accused’s sexual history, preferences, and sexual performance. With compassion for those who have had their careers, relationships, families, self-esteem, and lives destroyed by false allegations, anonymity for the accused remains a bad idea.
Advocacy for the falsely accused is dependant on the courts remaining open…. CONTINUE….

Title: God Tells Us How to Define Him
Author: Jennifer Lokken

Category: Essays
Date: July 21, 2018
Entry: 
By: Jennifer J. Lokken
“How often we hear this sort of thing: ‘I like to think of God as a great Architect(or Mathematician or Artist).’ ‘I don’t think of God as a Judge; I like to think of [sic]him simply as a father.’ We know from experience how often remarks of this kind serve as the prelude to a denial of something that the Bible tells us about God. It needs to be said with the greatest possible emphasis that, THOSE WHO HOLD THEMSELVES FREE TO THINK OF GOD AS THEY LIKE ARE BREAKING THE SECOND COMMANDMENT” ~ J.I. Packer, “Knowing God” ~
For the record the Second Commandment is as follows:
“You shall not make for yourself an image in the form of anything in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the waters below. You shall not bow down to them or worship them; for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but showing love to a thousand generations of those who love me and keep my commandments.” ~ Exodus 20:4-6 ~
I honestly don’t care what anyone thinks God is or isn’t, my job as Christian is to know who God says He is, believe what He says He is and reject anything that is not of Him.
Quite often we Christians we mistake Lucifer as Christ, by that, I mean we want to tell God who He is and by so doing make ourselves god, a god that you define is by definition an idol. We have so many idols to cast out and we don’t know it because we call them god.
I personally know far too many Christians whose entire faith is rooted in this clear violation of the Second Commandment. They justify their faith by what and who they think God is. This is a huge and systemic issue, especially in the Evangelicals community, where there is little emphasis on sound doctrine, church history, or basic theology, where the sole doctrine seems to be rooted in, “All I have to do is a say a prayer asking Jesus in my heart and I am good to go.” Any talk or expectations of spiritual growth and or sanctification, is met with opposition and accusations of Legalism.
I am reminded of the verses Romans 1:21-23:
“because, although they knew God, they did not glorify Him as God, nor were thankful, but became futile in their thoughts, and their foolish hearts were darkened. 22 Professing to be wise, they became fools, 23 and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image made like [h]corruptible man—and birds and four-footed animals and creeping things.”
These people clearly know God or at least claim too, when it says that they turned the truth of God into corruptible things of man, that is what happens when we define who we think God is. Note the creatures that we turn Him into, a beast of burden to provide our needs and wants and creepy thing to gotten rid of when we get the parts of God that make us uncomfortable. Sadly, it is those areas of God that make us the most uncomfortable is where we need Him the most.
Think about how much of our Christian faith is focused on ourselves. Our songs of worship in our modern age are more like demands of God to be at beck and call, turning Him into a beast of burden. Instead of what it should be, a time to think of God, His glory, His Holiness, His grace and acknowledge our lacking, and in our lacking in pure gratitude for His sufficiency in all areas, we praise His name(I say praise, because in corporate setting, proper worship is not always appropriate, because once you realize who you are in the light of who God is, the only worship that is possible is to prostrate yourself in His presence.)
It should be noted that the most sound way to get know yourself and who you are, isn’t hours of introspection, but to truly get to know who God is, then you will know who and what you are not.

We face the inevitable “…emergence of a new society whose members will disproportionately be descended from parents who rejected the social tendencies that once made childlessness and small families the norm. These values include an adherence to traditional patriarchal religion and a strong identification with one’s own folk or nation.”
 suggest that globalist Libertarians adjust and realize: people like national identity, people like borders, people like traditional relationships, and people like God and won’t stop liking God, anywhere ever. And you can’t reduce these things to mere sentiment–and whether it’s materialist Socialism or materialist Libertarianism, most of us want nothing to do with a technocratic elite society running on materialist economic or other ideologies. God and Family and Country will never go away. Libertarians will have to adjust or give it up methinks.

His videos touch upon religion, philosophy, and politics, and the intersection of all three. Channels similar to mine include Sargon of Akkad and Vee.

Entry: 
One thing I’m eternally grateful for: despite all my failings and misfortunes and poor confused life choices, I’m able to pray and read the Bible with my son every day. I wish I’d had that as a kid, I wouldn’t have wound up wasting so many decades as a dreary atheist/spiritual wanderer.
Saint Augustine reads the scriptures.
I’m giving him a firm understanding of the Scriptures and the True Ancient Faith passed down directly from Christ and the Apostles, through the established organized Church and the direct chosen successors of Christ’s Chosen Apostles (they’re called Bishops) not just a bunch of people running around reading Bibles to each other and speaking with the “authority” of self-appointed fools with charisma and loud voices and blind arrogance.
We’re in the middle of Exodus now. I have to stop periodically, as I did in Genesis, to explain various ways people lie about the Bible, and all the way they lie about the Orthodox Catholic Church that wrote and compiled and preserved that Bible. Now we’re in Exodus, and I stop periodically to point out the ways they twist and pervert the book of Exodus to say bizarre things. Like the bizarre claim we’re not supposed to have statues or icons, or that intercessory prayers invoking the Saints are wrong (even though both Old and New Testament fully support it). Heresy and blasphemy abides from people who “just go by what’s in the Bible” whether they be Atheist or Evangelical, so as a father I’m glad I can let him know about all of it, so he doesn’t get fooled by them.
Having to stop to note all these wicked lies about the the Church Christ built upon Peter and the Apostles is tiring, but I feel like it’s also a gift I can give him. I don’t want him as lost as I was.
When we finish the Old Testament, we’ll be moving on to the Lives of the Saints, so he can begin to understand the full breadth of the Living Faith that spans 5,000 years of beautiful unbroken Holy Sacred God-derived Divine Tradition from Moses to St. John Paul the Great.

The Church will have shrunk drastically in America by the time he’s in his 20s, though it’ll continue to grow worldwide. The vicious smears of the Seculars, the Marxist Entryists, and the often so hateful and willfully ignorant Evangelicals, will have taken their final toll. But from there, I expect a recovery, as I suspect the Internet will eventually be the undoing of Sola Scriptura, as well as the undoing of Atheism.
Still, it’ll be a lifelong struggle against abuse and lies. But I think he’s up to it. I’ll arm him as best I can. 😉
I pray Our Lady always watches over him and keeps him out of the hands of those who would lie about Christ’s Church. Which, BTW, he established on the Apostles and their chosen successors at Pentecost, and as faithful Christians have continued doing for 2000 years, to this very day, as attested and affirmed by the Holy Scriptures.
People who have only the Bible have a sadly truncated Faith and lack the full Truth of the Gospel. I pray one day they see the error of their ways. Until then, I pray Our Lady always keeps him safe from their hands. They may be well-meaning, but a well-meaning fool is still a fool.

It’s true. Young white Americans are fleeing the Democratic Party. This is tragic in more than one way. For years many of us tried to warn EVERYBODY who was liberal (I still considered myself one in many ways until a few years ago) that racism against whites was a thing and was growing and if this kept up white people would simply stop CARING if you called them racist. And mostly, more and more white people don’t. They’ll #WalkAway from Democrats, and they’ll be screamed at as racists, misogynists, self-hating, Nazis, traitors, etc.—and they’ll just keep walking away.
It’s tragic because racism is a sin and it’s wrong and we should all be worried about being racist–by which I mean REAL racist, the kind dripping with hate, and not just non-PC opinions.﻿

There was once a hard working father who had a lazy son. One day, tired of his son’s antics and carefree lifestyle told him “Go out in the world and come back to me with a coin you earned through work yourself, otherwise you won’t live under the same roof as me anymore”
First, the son asks his mother for a coin. He comes back to his father after a day of doing nothing. The father throws the coin in the fire and says “that wasn’t earned by you”
Confused, the son thinks that his mother told on him, so he borrows a coin from his friend. The father, furious, throws the coin in the fire once again. This time, he tells him that he won’t let him sleep in his house until he earns his coin.
Reluctantly, the son hires himself at a local farmer and works hard for a week. 
He comes back and proudly shows his father the coin. However, the father throws the coin in the fire once again.
Panicking, the son shoves his hand in the fire and takes the coin back, not caring that he burned himself.
That is when the father told him “Now you know the value of a coin you earned with your own sweat.”
This is why SJWs dont value money. They only had it handed to them their entire privileged lives

Author: John Bosco

Category: Escaping Atheism
Date: July 6, 2018
Entry: 
I restate that the Intelligence who both created and sustains the universe is real and necessary. 
God necessarily exists outside of our universe of energy, time, space and matter.  Those qualities are contingent and rely on outside forces to bring them into existence.  The Big Bang occurred 13-14 billion years ago.  That is when all four of those phenomenas came into being.  Nevertheless there was God who is without beginning or end because He exists outside of time.
Finite beings trapped inside the laws of physics cannot truly comprehend how there actually was the divine intellect (actualized existence) prior to the existence of the infinite universe.
An analogy might be to use the Digital Universe Theory, which states that the universe is a digital simulation.  In this case, God is both the programmer and architecture of the hardware of the simulation.
Some Atheists claim that if something is not provable by their ‘god’ Empirical science, it cannot exist. When this assertion is made or someone rejects the idea of free will, God, or any other ‘intangible’ or ‘abstract, they must necessarily reject all such concepts.
The laws of mathematics, physics, gravity and all other natural laws are used to measure or calculate, but are themselves unmeasurable.   Why do the atheists not reject these things?  Would that be inconvenient to their ’cause’?  The concept of ‘good’ and ‘evil’ belongs solely to religion.  The West was built by the Judeo-Christian concepts of charity, cooperation, selflessness and the belief that the whole of reality reflects The Creator.  
Believing that studying nature will guide the observer to God, Christianity was the spearhead of science.  The  dedication of the monks and nuns preserved knowledge and learning through the thousand-plus years between the fall of Rome and the Renaissance.  With very few exceptions (beginning in the 19th Century) every scientist of note was and is religious.  They are also mostly Christian.
Atheists condemn all religion, everywhere and for all time, by citing the abhorrent behaviors of only a few  people who claimed to be religious, yet acted in direct contradiction to the values and teachings of their faith.  At the same time, they hold all atheists innocent of the verifiable, catastrophic slaughters of 200 million-plus  by people who loudly, proudly claimed their atheism.
Rather they cite the religious education from the people’s youth.  Somehow the atheists of today can repudiate their religious upbringing and be ‘true atheists’ while the atheists responsible for mass slaughter were unable to do so.  It may be that no one screamed ‘Atheism” as they loosed the bullet or blade that killed,  the ideology that demanded and justified  the dehumanization and industrial -scale slaughter REQUIRED Atheism because the absence of God and religious morality. 
Despite their claims to the contrary, Good without God is fallacious.  The abolition of God must necessarily abolish all laws based upon God’s decrees.  Just as Catholicism built the foundation and culture of Western Science, it built it’s Civilization and culture.  That includes each and every law and cultural expectations.  Atheist cultures have produces no uplifting or entrancingly beautiful art, music, poems or prose.  
Atheism demands absolute obedience to the ideology of itself and anything built upon it.  Art of any type demands freedom.  Humans feel repressed and angry under totalitarianism, because we were built for more.  We were built for Theism and God; the ubiquitousness of theism throughout the world proves it.  Few were Christian to begin with. but Christianity (non-violently for the most part) peacefully conquered the pagan world with the message of God’s forgiveness and love.

Escaping Atheism started in late 2016 as an independent project, that is now part of Red Pill Religion. The Escaping Atheism project i: Secular Social Criticism of Modern Atheism. It came out of an earlier project “God and Man in the 21st Century” which tried to engage the Atheist community with politeness and humor, and to simply ask Atheists to get along with people and have tolerance.

Our kinder, gentler project was savaged, mocked, and ignored, while we watched countless religious people being persecuted online every day.
We realized we were now in the Sh*tposting era of the Internet, and no one respected “nice” anymore. And frankly, Jesus had never been particularly “nice” in his work.
It had became obvious after #Gamergate that marginalizing, lying about, and abusing religious people was the real goal of organized Atheism and so-called “Skepticism” and “Rationalism.” These weren’t like the old Atheists, they weren’t confused. They were filled with hate, and they wanted to destroy anyone who wouldn’t be Atheist with them.
Sargon of Akkad, Kraut & Tea, and other hateful and abusive bigots in the “Anti-SJW Atheist” crowd were and are no better than the vast majority of SJWs (which is to say, the majority of Dogmatic Atheists today.) We’ve met most of our preliminary goal, which was the complete destruction of the Atheist/Skeptic/Rationalist Community, using multiple social media strategies and guerilla campaigns, as well as our YouTube channel. Working with many volunteers, almost all an Anons project.
At Red Pill Religion we no longer focus exclusively on the Atheism cult movement. It is near dead and should be all but gone in a year. Thus we are discussing ratcheting down our tone and our language and expanding our subject matter. But for those who still wonder: we were never a ministry. We were Secular Social Critics of Atheism.
Today we will discuss history, and the need to change tone and change focus, now that the Atheist cult movement is nearly dead.
Our team included friendly atheists, and Pagans from day 1, and now includes Jews, Hindus, Deists, people with Buddhist backgrounds, and others. Religious people are completely normal, as sane as you, and a permanent part of your life. Red Pill Religion explores the intersection of culture, politics, science, and religion, from a Red Pill perspective.

This interview from early 2017 is an early look at the Escaping Atheism project, about 3 months after it had started. It came from an earlier project “God and Man in the 21st Century” which tried to engage the Atheist community with politeness and humor, and to simply ask Atheists to get along with people and have tolerance. 



That was savaged, mocked, and ignored, while we watched countless religious people being persecuted online every day.

A thrash metal tune by some anarchists condemning Militant Identitarian Atheism, who notice how hypocritical and dishonest they are, and what they’re really all about.

Lyrics (Copied from YouTube channel. Subscribe to BackWordz Music for more like this.)
WHEN I LAY BACK AND REST MY EYES, I CAN’T HELP BUT NOTICE. AND IT REALLY BLOWS MY MIND. SOMETIMES IT’S HARD TO FOCUS. IT’S THEIR PULPIT AND THEY WORSHIP. IT’S REALLY FUNNY HOW THEY BE TALKING DOWN ON THE RELIGIOUS. A HYPOCRITE WHEN THEY RUN THEIR MOUTH THE ONE THEY WORSHIP IS FAR MORE DANGEROUS WITH A BIGGER BODY COUNT AND IT’S FAR MORE FAMOUS. GO TO THE ALTAR, TO YOUR VOTE. THERE’S NO MORAL GROUND. BEG TO YOUR MASTERS, TO YOUR GODS. THEY WON’T HEAR YOU. A SIMILAR LEVEL AND YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL ‘CAUSE YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN CHRIST. MAY NOT BE MUSLIM, OR BUDDHIST, OR HINDU, OR JEWISH. THOSE JUST AREN’T THE ONES YOU LIKE. I DON’T MEAN NO DISRESPECT. YOU LOVE THE LAW BOOKS, AND YES, YOU CLING TO TEXT. JUST NOT THE BIBLE, AND IT’S OBVIOUS THAT HYPOCRITICAL IS WHAT YOU GET, MAN. WALKING CONTRADICTION. I KNOW SOME OF YOU PROBABLY MAD AT ME. YOU TRY TO LEGISLATE MORALITY. BUT YOU ARE A FRAUD. STOP ACTING LIKE YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN GOD. SAY IT. WE KNOW THE TRUTH. SAYING HAIL MARY’S AT THE VOTER BOOTH. YOU ARE A FRAUD. STOP ACTING LIKE YOU DON’T BELIEVE IN GOD. ACTING LIKE THEY MADE US.

Title: Why Is Jimmy Metokur Such A Cowardly P*ssy?

Entry: 
A couple of years ago, when I was doing Men’s Rights work fighting false allegations in places like the US and UK, there was a huge political blowup in Germany. It was reported (initially) that a thousand Muslim men had publicly raped (not “assaulted,” literally RAPED) 100 German women on the streets during that very night’s New Year’s celebrations in Cologne.
At that time I had been working extensively with false rape victims and covering false rape allegations. I had recently been working with Erin Pizzey on a false allegation case in the UK, where an innocent man was finally released thanks to her efforts, and I had been covering the Emma Sulkowicz Mattress Girl false rape claim at that time. I had also done work with the wrongfully accused on and off for years, and worked with others who did the same work.
So the second I heard “100 women raped on the streets by 1000 men in coordinated Jihadist attack in downtown Cologne to establish a Caliphate” (which was what was initially reported to me) I was immediately skeptical. “So 100 women in downtown Cologne on one night had their skirts and pants ripped off and were gang-raped each by 10 men? In the middle of New Year’s celebrations downtown? No, I don’t think so.”
I had tweeted out my skepticism, and several people from Europe started sending me stories from the news there, noting multiple cases of the police and government saying women were lying about rape by migrants. So now, not only was I skeptical, but people from Germany were tweeting me stories of false rape allegations in Europe. So I got even more skeptical.
Now the truth is, my concentration in politics from about 2012 to about 2016 was entirely on Men’s Rights issues–the way we drug and abuse boys in the schools, false allegations and their devastating effects, male rape and child abuse victims, the prison-industrial complex, and so on. I was aware of but not really focused on European politics, and I did believe (at that time) that many on the Right were grossly exaggerating the problem with the refugees/migrants/invaders/whatever you insist on calling them.
It’s what I thought because it’s what the press was telling me, and it was also what some Europeans were telling me. They said this was hysteria. Well, I’d seen lots of Rape Hysteria here in the States, and the UK, so why wouldn’t I believe them?
You could say I was “blue pilled.” To this day I do not believe at all that 100 women were literally raped on the streets of Cologne. I don’t think anyone else believes that anymore either. We know there was something bad and some women were attacked, and that it was part of an ongoing pattern of abuse of Europeans by these “migrants/refugees/invaders/whateveryouwannacallem.” But no, sorry, 100 women did not have their pants and skirts ripped off and get gang raped in Downtown Cologne. That did not happen. What did happen were muggings and assaults, including some sexual assaults and a few actual rapes. Which makes more sense and is a lot more realistic.
Also, I had been friends with Muslims on and off since the 1990s, including charity work together. Like Donald Trump and many others, I view Muslims as people we should try to get along with, even while we confront the radical terrorism problem. That is the view held by Donald Trump, is he some sort of Muslim sellout? I doubt it.
This is also why I was uncomfortable saying Cologne was a “Muslim Attack.” To this day I don’t see any reason to believe that was Jihadi activity that was religiously motivated; I think it was street gang thugs and hoodlums from other countries who don’t speak the language and can’t integrate into German culture. Maybe I’m wrong, but I still need to see more evidence that it was truly a coordinated plan to establish a Caliphate, as some like Jimmy Metokur were suggesting at the time.
In retrospect if I’d known what was actually going on over there, and if I’d realized at the time just how much the Globalist press was lying about sexual assault in Europe, I would have just stayed quiet until people calmed down. It also only took me a few weeks of reading and absorbing to realize: no, the press had been lying to us about what was going on in Europe. I see that now, though I didn’t at the time.
Anyway, when I posted my initial skepticism, I was immediately deluged with attacks on all sides, in a Twitter storm. Many prominent people who’d rarely interacted with me before were suddenly attacking me, among them Jimmy Metokur. And they weren’t listening to me, they were putting words in my mouth, accusing me, and giving me no chance at all to give a reasonable explanation, though I kept trying to tell them I was just skeptical and why I thought I had reason to be skeptical.
Even people like Davis Aurini and RooshV and Matt Forney and others got into the act. I tried talking to these men, tried getting them to listen to me, and they would not. Davis Aurini was particularly mystifying, as we’d met and talked pleasantly before, and as fellow Catholics I thought he’d at least TALK to me before accusing me.
RooshV and his RoK site had without provocation multiple times attacked Men’s Rights Activists, and had refused efforts I’d made in those days to talk to him, make him understand what we were trying to do, and make him understand we didn’t have to be enemies even though we sometimes disagreed on some things. But RooshV never would talk to me, still doesn’t seem like he will as he’s ignored several efforts. I did wind up writing a blistering attack article on him, but even that was based as much on previous abuse from him and his RoK site as anything; if the guy was going to keep smearing us, up to and including lying about what I really thought on Cologne, it seemed necessary to push back and call him out. He was hardly a Saint in those days.
To this day I’d still rather get along with people like Roosh, Davis, Forney, Metokur, etc. and work on issues where we share views and goals, but they didn’t seem interested.
The weirdest though was Jimmy Metokur. Jimmy and I had been in Gamergate together. Jimmy I had always thought was a goof, but also insightful sometimes, and overall not a bad guy. I was shocked when he came after me out of nowhere and wouldn’t even let me talk to him or explain. I asked him to talk to me and he agreed we would.
I messaged him privately a few times and said I’d cooled down and understood the situation better, and in reality we mostly agreed on most things. (Because we do.) I messaged him privately on both Twitter and Skype saying I thought we’d misunderstood each other, we agree on many things, and that I’d like to talk privately with him about it because there was no reason to fight. We were mostly on the same side.
Jimmy, being the Internet sh*tposter that he is, decided to prank me. I thought I was going into a private conversation with someone I’d been online allies with, shared the same enemies with, and that I’d just been confused and misunderstood.
However, Jimmy put me on the air without telling me. When I realized he’d done that to me I probably should have hung up, but I kept trying to reason with him. And of course we all know Jimmy, he just kept tweaking me and bullsh*tting me and hitting me with questions he knew were bullsh*t questions.
Sure I got emotional. Who wouldn’t? But that was the point. Jimmy’s ultimately a prankster who’s not serious about anything and doesn’t care about anyone. That’s too bad, he’s smart and talented and if he had a more functional life philosophy he’d probably be 10 times more popular by now. But whatever, he prefers to be a dick, so let him be a dick. I hung up, calmed down, rolled my eyes, and figured, “OK, an internet prank. You got me. Oh well.”
After that, on Twitter I was still being harassed by his goober followers, and attacked for even being friendly with Muslims. Someone accused me of being a secret Muslim, and I responded sarcastically that yeah I’m a Muslim now, Allahu Akhbar. Jimmy and his fans, pretty much knowing I was being sarcastic, decided to run with that as if it were serious, even though they all knew it wasn’t.
I really didn’t think it was gonna go much beyond that, but for about two and a half years now I still hear occasionally from Jimmy and more often from his fans, who keep repeating bullsh*t from Jimmy’s idiotic prank call–claiming I’m a Muslim, claiming I constantly change my positions, claiming I don’t do anything for men’s rights, claiming I don’t care about rape, etc. Ridiculous, all of it, but it keeps being repeated.
The usual response people have to these things is often to run off the internet and try to hide. Problem is, I won’t ever do that. I’ve been smeared, slimed, and harassed by way bigger and more powerful than Jimmy Metokur and his Tentacle-Porn Loving Fans, and I’ve got friends bigger and more powerful than him too. So it doesn’t bug me, but it is stupid and annoying. I usually just point out what douchebags Jimmy’s dumbass fans are, and they usually back off.
Still, I keep asking old Jimmy to talk to me again. I already accepted his apology on Andy Warski’s show when he admitted he was just pranking me. His fans who harass me admit it now too, most of them knew he was full of it when he did it they just thought it was funny.
Still, at some point you’d think Jimmy would say “OK joke’s over.” Yet he and his fans still seem to want to keep it going, years later. Why? Is it money, or just some need to pick on people you mostly agree with?
Anyway, I’ve sent Jimmy numerous private and public invitations to talk to me, my channel his channel or another channel. And I keep waiting for a response. Which he is apparently too cowardly to give.
So, to correct the record: I never denied anything at all happened in Cologne, I was skeptical when the story immediately came out, for good reasons. I never converted to Islam, I was being sarcastic, although I do have anti-Terrorist Muslim friends so you can hate me for that if you want. Then again, I agree that Islam isn’t compatible with Western values–which are after all Christian values. And I’m not a SocJus leftist.
Jimmy Metokur owes me a conversation. It’s an open invitation, even to get drunk with him. Jimmy admits he and his fans pranked me, and admits much of what he said there was not right. I’d like to shake hands and make friends. But to do that, the cowardly pussy has to answer the messages I send him, instead of ignoring them.
So Jimmy, when are you going to talk to me? With no setups, no pranks, just as guys who share a lot of the same worldview and similar struggles? I accepted that it was just a prank, and so did you, so why not clear the air?
Or ya just gonna keep being a sarcastic goober and spreading rumors about a guy you know aren’t true?
Hey if Jimmy still won’t answer, should we do a Kumite challenge? Or would the Kumite people be too afraid to let me on with Jimmy? They know I can match Jimmy body blow for body blow, and so does Jimmy after all. He might be too afraid.
Or maybe we could just talk like guys do, because honestly, we aren’t that different. Open invitation Jimmy, why don’t you shoot me a note and let’s talk?
PS: I’ll send this to Jimmy, but since he ignores my other contacts, if anyone else wants to send it to him that’d be useful.
PPS: Updated this 7/3/2018 to fix the stupid error of saying it was Copenhagen when I meant Cologne. Added a little extra detail too, of other things that turned out to be bullsh*t on the initial reports.

Title: Professional Atheist “Entertainers” Like Harassing Children?

*Update 10/21/18: Please see notes below:
I wish to state here for the public record that I believe two public figures who make money peddling anti-religious hate propaganda and pseudoscience, John Gleason the “Godless Engineer” and Kaitlyn Chloe, have intentionally and maliciously spread rumors on the Internet that I abuse my child.
They do this, I believe, knowing that it is indisputably groundless, in order to reputation-smear. Reputation-smearing is big business on the Internet, and many members of the online “Skeptic” movement are part of that business. They know full well one of the best ways to have plausible deniability is to express a phony “concern” with no basis at all, or the flimsiest pretext, and  then spread and encourage rumors that someone is a thief, a rapist, a child molester, or some other kind of miscreant.
These people and their co-coreligionists in cult groups like “The Great Debate Community” and “The Non-Sequitur Show” know something important: if you spread rumors that someone’s abusing a child, or is a rapist, or something similar, they KNOW that rumor will follow that person forever. They know the man they’ve falsely accused may face physical attacks from total strangers, job loss, business loss, and more. They even know it may trigger fake reports to the police or Child Protective Services, just to harass their victim and his family.
John Gleason the “Godless Engineer” and his partner, Kaitlyn Chloe, two very public figures who make money on the Internet, have intentionally targeted my child for harassment, knowing that by spreading these fake rumors both me and my child may face harassment and discrimination and more at school or work. They intentionally traumatized a child, just to spread a malicious rumor. To get revenge on someone who had criticized their public work as public figures.
Public figures like professional Christian- and Jew-haters John Gleason and Kaitlyn Chloe, along with other public figures associated with them putting out public content on the Internet, owe apologies to my son Max Jr. They also owe apologies to me, my wife, my ex-wife Rosemary, and her current husband John Ribner. So does anyone at “The Great Debate Community” or “The Non-Sequitur Show” who continues to tolerate this inexcusable harassment of an innocent child and his parents and step-parents and family. Or to asssociate with known Internet Harassers and Abusers.
This is also posted publicly in case of SWATting attempts and phony reports to try to waste police and CPS time. Which we expect to happen sooner or later; the creepy Internet Skeptic hate cult does not hesitate to try to destroy people by any means necessary, including endlessly repeating things they know to be lies.
These are people who will even go after children. And their friends think that’s OK. Remember this about them. And their friends.
*Update 10/21/18*: We recently appeared, hopefully for the last time ever, on the Non-Sequitur Show, me Max, Andrew Strateletes, and John Baptiste. During the show it came under contention that somehow, Godless Engineer had never suggested I abused my child, and claiming that this article you are reading here was published somehow before Godless Engineer made such insinuations. 

However, as this video by Orthodox Defender shows, made well before this article was written, no, the idea that I’m a danger to my child for teaching him about God and teaching him to defend himself against Atheist bullies is something Godless Engineer was putting into the air already. And as I have noted, the “teaching your child religion is child abuse” is a common Ideological Atheist trope. As I have also noted many times, in my years of political activism I saw how spreading rumors that you’re a rapist or abusing your child are used to do things like trigger Family Court or phony Child Protective Services investigations, or to just get people attacked on the streets. 
I will note also that our friend Deflating Atheism, who saw the original interaction, told the Non-Sequitur Show people he would not appear on their show until I get a retraction and an apology, and so far as I know none was ever given. I was not the only one to interpret Mr. Gleason’s words as a thinly veiled attempt to offend, to further the common Ideological Atheist trope that teaching kids about God is child abuse, and to spread rumors about me on the Internet.
No one suggested that any specific person did or would call CPS. That’s not how it works when you’re spreading rumors about someone, you get other people to do your dirty work. I don’t believe anything these people say anymore; King Crocoduck demonstrably misrepresents the history of science and the philosophy of science and the state of contemporary Evolutionary Biology and isn’t really qualified in that field, and has said many hateful things about religion in his time. Godless Engineer is who he is, anyone can just listen to him. And Steve McCrae loves to maintain plausible deniability by denying having any responsibility for anything his friends and fellow cultists have to say, so if he didn’t say it then it’s “libel” to say he routinely gives people saying hateful things a platform. And Kyle Curtis lacks the guts to admit that “Gay Rights” only happened by asking Christians for support, and won’t talk about the reality that Secular and Atheist sources all over the world and all over history have been virulently, even murderously, anti_Gay. Whatever. These people hate religion and they treat religious people like garbage. I feel good for those religious folks who can befriend them; I don’t have the strength to sit and listen to such abuse.
I genuinely hope we are done with these jokers as of today. I can’t see where our talking with them does anyone any good.
*Update 2:* No, one more. I really am one of the common survivors of pedo rings that get covered for in Secular Schools, Police Departments, Foster Home Systems, and Juvenile Prisons regularly. Anyone who has done work in this area knows that it’s true there’s a problem all over government systems; simply searching the Internet for examples of the Secular schools (and other facilities) covering for pedos is child’s play. I did work in this area for years as a Men’s advocate, however, a quick search online gives example after example after example. Anyone who’s done work with the abused knows where the pedos go, and they can be found in any profession just about. 
The Catholics are doing a lot about their sex abuse problem (see the work of Church Militant for one of many examples), whereas others are silent about their own epidemic. Picking on one group to the exclusion of all others is hypocrisy and bigotry and using victims as your political pawns, and all of these people and their apologists know it. 
As both a father and a survivor, I still know, my child is in more danger from his public schoolteachers than he is from our priests. A statistical reality that matters I think.
*Update 3* We really did have multiple victims of the Secular Foster Home & School System approach Steve about their experiences and get haughtily dismissed as having a case of “whataboutism.” Nice way to marginalize people Steve. Dismissing child sex abuse survivors and their experience so you can go after one religious group you don’t like is bigotry, especially when you’re rude to other victims who approach you about your dismissal of their experiences.

Title: Great Debate Community: Dishonest Bullies & Cowards

There is no web site on the Internet where you will get more bad information on science and history than Steve McRae’s utterly laughable and 98% vile “Great Debate Community.”
For some time we on the Red Pill Religion team had tried to engage the bizarre little hate cult that is “The Great Debate Community” constructively.
The shadowy little clique surrounding The Great Debate Community sent quite a few disingenuous, slimy people, men and women alike, to come and try to convince us that there is no organized, malevolent movement calling itself capital A Atheism. To tell us there is  no cult religion called capital S Skepticism—even though every single one of them was very obviously part of an organized movement and clique sent to propagandize and recruit.
Or, as in the case of the utterly vile “Godless Engineer” John Gleason and his hateful partner Kaitlyn Chloe, to simply bully and abuse people, and even target their children for harassment. While lying about science and history.
Some friends of Red Pill Religion, not official team members, tried for a while to get us into friendly relationships with some of the people there, but it was not to be. Even the people who pretended to be “nice” like Shannon Q, Kyle Curtis, and a few others all eventually turned out to be hateful lying bigots just trying to bring people into the capital A Atheist fold–by which I mean the creepy anti-Christian, anti-Jewish, anti-Muslim, anti-Hindu, anti-Pagan, anti-Zoroastrian, hate cult they’re all part of.
They’re very much like Scientologists.
BTW, if you ever want proof that these people are a cult? Even if you’re an atheist or agnostic? Go in there for a week and start saying you think OK, maybe it’s rational think there’s a God. You’ve looked at the evidence and you don’t find it convincing but you can see why an intelligent person might. See how they treat you: like you’ve picked up an infectious disease and mind-virus, or became an idiot, or a traitor. That is how you’ll be treated. Especially if you also say things like, “come on, we should be friends with religious people.”(See *)
You will be treated like a Jehovah’s Witness who has begun to question the Watchtower Society. I guarantee you.
Yesterday I found that our friend Derek, the Gay Atheist Anrchist, got banned from Great Debate Community, while others like our friend White Injun get routinely muted, bullied, and abused just trying to make a polite point. I’ve been in the Great Debate Community’s chat server for a few months but am leaving today as a result of this ongoing behavior of bullying and bigotry and intellectual dishonesty.
While there are obviously a few decent, if confused and deluded, people hanging at the Great Debate Community, it’s mostly a pit of filthy bigots no better than NeoNazis or Communists. Filthy bigots who routinely, and in many cases knowingly and intentionally, strawman and misrepresent religion and religious people with phony science, fake spun history, idiotic armchair psychoanalysis, and encouraging an intolerant, condescending,  superior, elitist, bullying attitude towards religious people.
They think they are The Thought Police, who will tell everybody else what is rational or acceptable to believe.
When I think of the Great Debate Community, I think of a swirling nest of bigoted snakes. The loudest most obnoxious ones are actually the more honest ones; they’re open about their hate and revel in being bullies. The really devious, poisonous snakes among them pretend to be nice, and even like they want to be your friend.
(Here’s a hint: you do not need a “friend” who treats you like you’re mentally ill or a simpleton.)
I’ve left the Great Debate Community’s Server. Their “Great Debate” is a fraud in every way. The Great Debate Community CONTINUALLY repeats demonstrable lies about religion, misrepresents human history, lies about and misrepresents contemporary science, and teaches its members and followers to treat religious people as if they are inferior subhuman and defective.
Which is all the rest of the capital-A Atheist movement has ever done, whether it’s with low-level Internet pseudoscientists like PZ Myers, or filthy con men with “mainstream” respectability like Penn Jillette or Sam Harris.
Those of us who think there’s a God and that supernatural forces are real get treated like we are a threat, like we are stupid, and like we need to be psychoanalyzed by these pompous elitists. It makes fans of the Great Debate Community and the rest of the creepy, bigoted Atheist Movement unbelievably nasty, condescending, ignorant douchebags. If you’re a fan of the Great Debate Community and wonder why you seem to have few if any friends, consider the possibility that it’s because hanging out there makes you unpleasant and nasty.
Because Capital A, Identitarian, Movement Atheists  and “Skeptics” who hang out all day with others Atheists talking about how bad religion is, and how irrational the rest of humanity is, are really hateful nasty people. They’re unpleasant to be around most of the time, have you noticed?
What you might also notice is that the longer you hang out with them, the more nasty cynical and unlikeable you become, too.
Also please notice, over time they all tend to turn on and savage each other. Like Lord of the Flies.
Anti-Theists are irrefutably the biggest haters and biggest bullies and biggest terrorists on the Internet. Those of you who are friends with them are being “tolerant” of hateful abusive bullies who go after people’s children like John Gleason and his hateful abusive partner Kailtyn Chloe. These people routinely lie about science, routinely lie about history, and routinely abuse and bully religious people, either for fun or for profit.
Up to and including intentionally and knowingly quoting their critics out of context. Or talking only to the dumbest religious people. Or psychoanalyzing people who disagree with them. And acting like anyone who disagrees with Atheism must be mentally ill or defective somehow. (Nobody is better at that very Nazi-like pretend-psychoanalysis than “nice” and “polite” pseudointellectual bigot Steve McRae, BTW.)
I left Capital-A Atheism, creepy fake capital S “Skepticism,” because I realized it was a bizarre intolerant thought-control cult. Great Debate Community has PROVEN to me that that is all it EVER has been, and probably all it ever can be.
If anyone over at “The Great Debate Community” ever wants to STOP being a hateful bigoted dishonest manipulative bully, if you want to STOP being someone who only PRETENDS to be nice, and you want to be a decent human being and just be FRIENDS with religious people, UNDERSTAND and get along with spiritual people, stop on by Red Pill Religion. But otherwise, I will repeat what I said in my public videos:
I apologize for excessive cuss words and excessive loud voice in the past videos and will try to do better. But I believe I had every right to be angry, and that others have just as much right to be angry. And I have no apologies at all for rightly identifying hateful bigoted bullies and cultists who pretend they aren’t in a cult, and who pretend they have no ideology. And I have no apologies at all for publicly identifying and condemning the bullying behavior, the pseudoscience, or the pseudohistory.
And I will continue to note that these are filthy people who went after my child.
I don’t care if any of them likes me or likes this project. I don’t like any of them. At all. They’re awful, horrible people, no better than abusive bigots like Matt Dillahunty or Kyle Kulinski. Or that two-faced con artist Penn Jillette.
Goodbye Great Debate Community. For a couple of years everybody told me I was too mean to you, that I should try to be friendly. I tried. We tried. But there’s no point. When you’re dealing with intolerant mind-control cult like Scientology or Steve McRae’s “The Great Debate” community, you can’t expect honest dialogue or reasonable debate. They’re a cult that simply pretends to want to explore ideas.
Red Pill Religion will continue to run its efforts to alert the public to the identitarian, bullying, thought-control cult that is Capital-A Atheism, and phony Capital S “Skepticism,” until we see the movement reform itself or cease to exist. Whether these bullies call themselves “Free Thinkers,” “Liberalists,” or “Skeptics,” they need to reform, or they need to be shunned by decent people everywhere.
Red Pill Religion will otherwise continue to welcome and have dialogue with friendly atheists, agnostics, deists, Buddhists, Shintoists, Hindus, Pagans, Zoroastrians, Muslims, and anyone else who wants to have honest conversations and even spirited debates. The only people we don’t put up with are haters and bullies, pseudoscientists and pseudohistorians, such as the ones who currently swirl like flies around The Great Debate Community.
*Update*: We got a complaint because there are a lot of theists hanging around specifically at the Great Debate Community who don’t get taken out. Point taken. Religious people who are new and don’t know much often get treated OK there for a while. But anyone who’s a regular who’s actually smart enough to challenge them on their endless use of pseudoscience and pseudohistory, or who challenges their casual every day bigotry toward religious people, or correctly notes the base fraud that there is any “Great Debate Between Science And Religion,” will be marginalized, muted, ejected, insulted, smeared, and faced with other silencing tactics.
I do not believe the people running The Great Debate Community will do anything to fix any of this. They were offered a hand of friendship, private conversations to clear up misunderstandings. They refused.

Thinking Ape is a MGTOW Philosopher that seeks an honest dialogue with religious people on YouTube, and makes some insightful remarks on spirituality. Unfortunately, he gets some rather fundamental things wrong due to his materialist and anti-Catholic assumptions. Red Pill Religion seeks to correct him on this and shows him the alternative to the materialist mindset that he seems trapped in.

Title: Why do we focus on Harms against Women?
Author: OdaStOda

Category: Essays
Date: June 19, 2018
Entry: 
By: Patanjali
Why do we focus on Harms against Women? Violence Against Women and related phenomena? Rape of Women – by Men? Here are some explanations:
A. Missing White Woman Syndrome:
“Missing white woman syndrome is a phrase used by social scientists[1] [2][3] and media commentators to describe the extensive media coverage, especially in television, of missing person cases involving young, white, upper-middle-class women or girls.[4] The phenomenon is defined as the media’s undue focus on upper-middle-class white women who disappear, with the disproportionate degree of coverage they receive being compared to cases of missing women of other ethnicities and social classes, or with missing males of all social classes and ethnicities.[5][6]”
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_white_woman_syndrome
B. “The Women Are Wonderful Effect”.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E2%80%9CWomen_are_wonderful%E2%80%9D_effect
The idea pretty clear in the wikipedia page. But the implications are deep. For example, for every crime done by women there is a good reason for it. For any harm women do we must understand and empathize with them. For any punishment meted to women, it should be less than for men. For any harm done by women, it is given less coverage than when done by men.
In detail, here are examples:
1. Women pedophiles are given less harsh treatment.
http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/11/18/double-standard-seen-when-boys-sexually-abused-by-women/3615947/
2. Women get lighter prison sentences. You may recall in Texas Karla Faye Tucker was executed by Bush. Everyone recoiled in horror because it was a woman. Gasp!!!
http://www.law.umich.edu/newsandinfo/features/Pages/starr_gender_disparities.aspx
3. Violence against women vs violence against men. The former is an atrocity (TM) and the latter is trivial.

4. Rape! Nothing bad should ever happen to women. Especially to white women! But other humans??? Fuck em.
High Prevalence of Sexual Victimization Detected Among Men; Similar to Prevalence Found Among Women in Many Cases

5. Rape Culture!!! College is a haven for Rape Culture (TM). Because Patriachy! Yet most teen gang rapists are girls.
http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131007-sexual-violence-rape-teenagers-sociology/
6. Protect our girls!!! And our boys?? Who gives a shit? Stop sidelining the real issues!!!
http://time.com/37337/nearly-half-of-young-men-say-theyve-had-unwanted-sex/
7. Domestic violence against women is bad! Especially when it happens to celebrities! But the reality? Who cares when the feelings of white women are at stake??
http://time.com/2921491/hope-solo-women-violence/
https://nationalparentsorganization.org/blog/20971-partner-abuse-state-of-knowledge-project-the-gold-standard-of-domestic-violence-information
Now it would be simple to say, aha! This must be The Matriachy (TM) instead of The Patriarchy (LLC). But that would be being as dumb as Feminists. No. This all arose from civilization. And civilization arose from evolution. But the hypocrisies have become astoundingly apparent. Thankfully for our sons the Feminist house of cards is crumbling before us like the name implies. Basic data and questions instead of the all important feelings of straight white women.

Machiavelli Quote: ““It may be, however, as certain philosophers maintain, that the air is peopled with spirits who by their superior intelligence foresee future events and out of pity for mankind warn them by such signs so that they may prepare against the coming evils.”
The Ghost of Caesar:
This is the Shakespeare version:
Enter the GHOST of Caesar
How ill this taper burns!—Ha, who comes here?
I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
That shapes this monstrous apparition.
It comes upon me.—Art thou any thing?
Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil
That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
Speak to me what thou art.
GHOST
Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
BRUTUS
Why comest thou?
GHOST
To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
BRUTUS
Well, then I shall see thee again?
GHOST
Ay, at Philippi.
People waste time debating why Shakespeare added that scene. He added it because it was the part of the recorded history. 
Here is Plutarch, from chapter 46 of his LIFE OF BRUTUS:
“Once, accordingly, when he [Brutus] was about to take his army across from Asia, it was very late at night, his tent was dimly lighted, and all the camp was wrapped in silence. Then, as he was meditating and reflecting, he thought he heard some one coming into the tent. He turned his eyes towards the entrance and beheld a strange and dreadful apparition, a monstrous and fearful shape standing silently by his side. Plucking up courage to question it, “Who art thou,” said he, “of gods or men, and what is thine errand with me?” Then the phantom answered: “I am thy evil genius, Brutus, and thou shalt see me at Philippi.” And Brutus, undisturbed, said: “I shall see thee.”

Title: Free Will vs Determinism: Does our Autonomy Supersede God’s Sovereignty?
Author: OdaStOda

Category: Essays
Date: June 12, 2018
Entry: 
By: Jennifer J. Lokken 
In regards to, the issue with Sam Harris, the fact is we are actually not autonomous creatures, which is where most who are Free Will absolutist are wrong. 
We are social creatures, as we have a biological drive to create more of us, to create associations beyond that of individual families, other social organizations are evidence of our need and drive to create a something beyond ourselves. 
The question of our autonomy, is what is the source of this bigger thing that determines what gives us our meaning. The two worldveiws that determine how we view this, there is heteronomously, which is the secular in nature and the root of the establishing of governments and states and nations. The other is theonomously or authority of God Himself, which must not supersede the heteronomous system in order for the governance of that system to be moral instead of nothing but the raw pursuit of power of the the individual, but to seek justice. 
Justice was most aptly defined by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn:
“Justice is conscience, not a personal conscience but the conscience of the whole of humanity. Those who clearly recognize the voice of their own conscience usually recognize also the voice of justice.”
In the theological aspect of things, the free Will vs Determinism argument is put in the terms of Free Will(“Arminianism is Pelagian, denying original sin and total depravity – No system of Arminianism founded on Arminius or Wesley denies original sin or total depravity”) vs God’s sovereignty(“Calvinism: the Protestant theological system of John Calvin and his successors, which develops Luther’s doctrine of justification by faith alone and emphasizes the grace of God and the doctrine of predestination.” 
Of these two doctrines, the truth is that our free will can only operate in the parameters of God’s Sovereignty, because the creation can supersede that of it’s creator, put differently, the finite cannot comprehend the infinite. 
So, in a sense both you and Harris are right, in so far as, in the battle of ideas, of Free Will vs Determinism, the truth is, your Free Will has been Pre-Determined. Because we cannot go beyond God’s Sovereignty without leaving the physical reality and we would lose all capability to comprehend and reason apart from God. 
This is why Atheist must borrow their morality and Ethics from a Christian worldview, they actually are incapable of creating their own. They try to get around this by using Utilitarian approach to ethics and morality, but that is nothing more than heteronomously being ruled by the majority and history is repleat with examples of how bad it is to let the majority decide much of anything. Or they claim that ethnics and morality are autonomously defined, but that is not the case because then claim appeals to authority to put deal with those who don’t fall in line with the ethics established by the majority.
I could go on and on explain how it even if you think morals are relevant, which is what happens if morals get to be established autonomously, but the fact that there are any morals and ethics at all are proof of an absolute moral law giver. But that will have to be another post, for another day.

Ideological capital-A Militant Atheists on Non-Sequitur Show have recently made it plain that they are the enemies of religious people and their children. And the Enemies of Free Thought and Free Expression. The question we must entertain, as religious people, or those who at least respect religious people: is the Atheist movement truly an enemy to Western Civilization?

Totalitarian Thought Police Nightmare Fuel on Non-Sequitur Show

Time points we plan to hit:
39:20-40:00 His Anti Theism and Morality
40:10-40:55 Religion is old therefore it has no moral authority 
1:01:18- 1:01:49 Children are pyschologically abused by religious indoctrination
1:02:10- 1:02:42 Religion is a problem not Atheism 
1:07:41 – 1:08:18 Religion limits humanities potential and don’t need to put ourself under divine rule and we at this point can lead our own path and it is dehumanizing to suggest that we can’t carve our own path. 
1:12:31-1:13:08 Creating a society without religion
1:21:13- 1:21:59 Liberal religiousity strengthens harmful religiousity 
1:22:38- 1:22:58 Modern Feminism and Islam dominating it
Atheist Mr. Dapperton calls out Nightmare Fuel as Potential Predator:

The Age of Atheism on the Internet is coming to an end. Religious people will no longer be bullied into silence.

The Atheist Voice has five stupid reasons not to teach religion to your child. Here are better reasons:
Do not teach religion to your child, so that:
1: He can be proud of his complete ignorance of what other people believe and think.
2: He can come off like a massive know-it-all elitist in all his daily affairs.
3: He can avoid making any serious friends with the vast bulk of humanity.
4: He can lose business and job and friendship and romantic opportunities on an almost daily basis without even knowing it! 
5: He can completely seal himself off from facts, thoughts, and ideas that threaten his ego.

Entry: 
Red Pill Religion has been accused of being “anti-gay” and of believing “gay” and “pedo” are the same thing. This is a lie on multiple levels. Red Pill Religion believes that people who self-identify as “gay” should be treated with respect as human beings. We believe pedos are dangerous and need to be put where they can’t hurt children. Max Kolbe, the founder of Red Pill Religion, is a survivor of Catholic-hating atheists in the secular school system who were pedos. He has had gay friends his entire adult life. Such smears are beneath contempt and get no further comment.

Aaron Ra blatantly denies the victims of Militant Atheist genocide. People who know honest history and who know actual survivors of Atheist atrocities have a few choice words for him and his hateful cult of followers.

Entry: 
A historian of unmatchable qualifications, Borden W. Painter Jr., retired History chair and President of Trinity College, shows that Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris, and Richard Dawkins are historical FRAUDS, using methods identical to that of those who try to rewrite history to deny the Holocaust ever happened. And that’s just when he’s being nice to them.

Please spread awareness of Borden Painter’s book as far and wide as you can.

Our friend Mr. Brass pretty much says it. Team Red Pill religion says that enough is enough with the Community strikes when the rules have not been made explicit and your ancient history can be used to beat you up. Google YouTube, you should start thinking that maybe you have gone too far and are hurting your brand and maybe put in stronger policies–just tell us what words not to use, and tell us what specifically would constitute “a threat” or “offensive” and people can try to obey you at least. Everyone is bewildered when you shift the rules every five minutes. Please restore Mr. Dapperton OR, give him AT LEAST an opportunity to move all his content to Private and give him an opportunity to save and download it and give him a chance to reform to whatever new specifications you want. Work with creators don’t just destroy them.

Entry: 
G Man is an extreme Fundamentalist Young Earth Creationist. Is he actually an embarrasment to Christianity? Well, more to his particularly odd brand.

G Man: Am I “embarrasing To Christianity”?

Time points we’ll try to hit:
2:35-2:53 says impressing other Christians isn’t important and how is he embarrassing Christians?
3:25-3:52 says his raps are entertaining and people are coming to Christ because of him
4:13-4:30 dismisses important of getting along with fellow Christians
5:39-6:23 says how bad Jesus was shamed and therefore if anyone was an embarrassment to Christianity it would be him
6:44-7:00 can’t see how fundamentalist embarrass Christianity
11:32-12:00 says how his opponents can’t discredit him intellectually

Entry: 
DYSTOPIA (from Greek, dys topos, “bad place”): The opposite of a utopia, a dystopia is an imaginary society in fictional writing that represents, as M. H. Abrams puts it, “a very unpleasant imaginary world in which ominous tendencies of our present social, political, and technological order are projected in some disastrous future culmination” (Glossary 218). For instance, while a utopia presents readers with a place where all the citizens are happy and ruled by a virtuous, efficient, rational government, a dystopia presents readers with a world where all citizens are universally unhappy, manipulated, and repressed by a sinister, sadistic totalitarian state. This government exists at best to further its own power and at worst seeks actively to destroy its own citizens’ creativity, health, and happiness. Examples of fictional dystopias include Aldous Huxley’s Brave New World, George Orwell’s 1984, Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale, and Ursula Le Guin’s The Dispossessed.

Tyler Preston wants to give rationalizations for his Atheism Victim Narrative, which is exactly like the Feminist Victim Narrative. It posits a phony claim that he and everyone else is somehow victims to the big bad Christians–and that anything he says or does to hurt or abuse or lie about Christians is therefore OK. Tonight we take this guy on and try to correct he and his hateful fans’s erroneous assertions.

We don’t always get along with The Distributist, who doesn’t like our abrasive style, but we’ve had about enough of lying blowhards like DarkMatter2552, and in reality, with his lies, Dark Matter squelches important voices. Like most of the Atheist thug community he helped create.

Here’s time points we’ll try to hit:
3:13:10 – 3:13:39 (I forgot) 3:15:18 – 3:17:07 (“muh Bible, because muh believers!”) 3:17:30 – 3:19:32 (“muh religion gets in the way of truth!”) 3:21:54 – 3:22:27 (muh Science oppression!) 3:22:33 – 3:22:53 (“not saying the scientists of old were secret atheists, just saying they WOULD of been atheists”) 3:25:06 – 3:26:25 (“Well, Girodano Bruno may not of been killed for his science, but he was a scientist who just so happened to be killed!”) 3:26:54 – 3:27:39 (“I don’t approve of anybody being killed”) 3:28:13 – 3:29:15 (back to Galileo) 3:29:45 – 3:30:42 (“when you die, you die. nothing matters”) 3:33:15 – 3:34:33 (“Copernicus was just catering to the church”) 3:36:19 – 3:38:09 (muh religion interfering with science) 3:40:47 – 3:43:09 (revising history) 3:44:30 –3:45:25 (“I’m not saying atheists should get credit”) 3:46:25 – 3:47:06 (“muh atheism increasing because of education”) 3:47:38 – 3:49:22 (“I’m not a Communist”) 3:56:28 – 3:57:18 (more Christian-bashing) 3:57:43 – 3:58:15 (projecting)3:58:24 – 3:59:41 (the end)

2:32:25–2:34:12 (Bitches about art)
2:34:19–2:34:50 (Basically says he just looks at garbage)
2:45:00 – 2:46:02 (DM states artwork is more “realistic”, than Medieval artwork, therefore more “scientific”)
2:52:32 – 2:53:52. Denial of the study of anatomy in the Medieval period.

CBS News, New York Times, other mainstream publications and even the #Skeptic network have begun declaring that maybe there is something to UFOs and alien encounters and more investigation is needed. So don’t laugh at us for talking about it: what’s the deal here? Joining us tonight is Joseph from CE4 Research/Alien Resistance, to talk about something few know: regardless of what “alien encounters” actually are, devout Christians don’t have them, and Christian prayers tend to drive aliens away from the non-devout. Now why would that be? Links: Research on Christianity and encounters with E.T.s: http://www.alienresistance.org/

Research on Christianity and encounters with E.T.s: http://www.alienresistance.org/
Story links:
These are just a random sample Max googled up of RECENT stories. CBS News and others have covered it, members of Congress have mentioned it. It’s like we’ve gone back in time.
Politico reports that the Pentagon set up a major new program to investigate UFOs 10 years ago (supposedly) and is only now (supposedly) letting the public know: https://www.politico.com/magazine/sto…
Droning think piece on the profundity of the phenomenon in New York Times: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/29/sc…

Canadian Government Decides It’s A Good Time To Issue Coins Celebrating UFO Encounters: https://www.inverse.com/article/43266…
…but literally we could go on with more and more links. The story is suddenly alive again, after decades of our being told it was silly kid stuff and tinfoil hat conspiracies.
What the truth is of UFOs is, we leave to you to decide. We see these basic options:
1: They’re more or less what they appear to be–aliens from out there in the cosmos.
2: They’re creatures from another dimension
3: They’re fairies/Fey, playing with us
4: They’re demons
5: They’re delusional/imaginary
6: They’re hoax and hysteria
7: I don’t know.
Max’s answer is 7, but his money’s heavily on 3 or 4, with a smattering of 5 and 6. “All hoax and hysteria” doesn’t work for us. Your mileage may vary.

Title: Karen Straughan and her Fake Honeybadgers: Betrayal of Men’s Human Rights
Author: Max Kolbe
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/04/06/karen-straughan-and-her-fake-honeybadgers-betrayal-of-mens-human-rights/
Category: Red Pill Movie
Date: April 6, 2018
Entry: 

We recently noticed that the University of Toronto’s Men’s Issues Awareness Society will be hosting Karen Straughan, of Red Pill Movie fame, and partner in the hideous anti-Christian and anti-Jewish “Honeybadger Brigade” — which it should be noted is nothing like the original Honeybadger Brigade from 2014, as seen in Cassie Jaye’s Red Pill Movie.
Karen Straughan has terribly betrayed most of the men who made her popular and accepted her as a standarbearer. She and her fake “Honeybadger Brigade” have run a years-long smear and harassment campaign against me and many others. Her group also spreads malicious anti-Christian and anti-Jewish hate propaganda, and MANY men on my team and friends of mine have faced persecution and harassment and lies from her and her fellows. She has also done much to suck money out of Cassie Jaye’s movie while Cassie Jaye gets crumbs, too.


 


Lots and lots of people are mad at this woman, including more than one to be found in Red Pill Movie. She will even lie and say I am mentally ill, “bitter,” mock me (and countless Veterans) for being “brain damaged,” and refuse to discuss specifics.


 


She may be facing legal action from more than one party before the year is out—ditto her partners in crime Alison Tieman, Mike “Randomercam” and possibly others in her circle. Please do not give her any support. And if you want to talk to me about it, the phone # is 248-242-0303. The specific charges are religious bigotry, religious abuse, harassment, slander, libel, and even (at least one report) physical assault from members of her “Honeybadger Brigade” team.


 


This is not a good person, and neither are her friends. I’m available to talk about it with any serious in inquirers, but before we talk you’ll have to accept: I represent more than one person, I do not make alegations lightly, and neither I nor anyone working with me will be mollified with words or entreaties for “unity” or told to “get over it.” She owes apologies and reparations to a lot of people, and if you trust her, she’ll eventually owe them to you too. She’s become the New Wooly Bumblebee.


 


Please do not support this woman in her speaking engagements, PARTICULARLY if you’re an audience that cares about the opinions of religious men.

Title: Is the Strength of Women Their Facade of Weakness? | Dean Esmay #RPRF

Dean Esmay comments:
This is a phenomenal movie and we’re incredibly impressed with what Cassie Jaye has achieved with it. The data in it is all top notch and very reliable.
Beware, however: After the movie was done shooting and was in editing, a Bait-and-Switch was pulled, primarily by Alison Tieman who took over and subverted #HoneybadgerBrigade, and Peter Wright (not his real name, he’s an Australian NeoMarxist from Queensland named Jason) took over, purging anyone who was at all spiritual (including New Agers with a positive outlook, as well as multiple Christians like myself as well as believing Jews) and turned to a “Gynocentrism” theory which seeks to blame religious men (like me) for Feminism and to demonize anyone who doesn’t want to accept their Postmodernist theory.
Peter Wright’s AVfM and Alison Tieman’s Honeybadger Brigade are NOT the groups they were when this movie was shot, and people at those organizations have engaged in harassment, smearing, and intentional calumny of many of us, to erase us and erase our role and erase who we are now. They also worked to deplatform people from after-movie Q&A and ignored multiple people who had their own showings and faced discrimination.
They also portray themselves as “The Men’s Human Rights Activists” while not giving credit to ANYONE else.
Once again it’s not just one person, it’s many, some of them now working with me on the Red Pill Religion project. Do not trust Honeybadgers in 2018. Don’t trust people from A Voice for Men either. They aren’t what they appear to be.
SOME of the same people from the movie are real, but they backstabbed and smeared many others after the movie was in the can.
Men’s Rights are an important topic, but unfortunately, the A Voice for Men and the Honeybadger Brigade I was part of creating and shaping is no more. Don’t trust those people. Don’t (necessarily) follow us either; instead, take the information and start looking for the MANY MANY groups, on Facebook on other platforms and elsehwere on the Internet, who reject the hatred of religious men and reject the Postmodernist “Gynocentrism” theory.

Title: King Crododuck / Dean Esmay Stream Corrections
Author: OdaStOda
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/03/26/king-crododuck-dean-esmay-stream-corrections/
Category: Videos and Essays
Date: March 26, 2018
Entry: 
By Jeff Michaels
Disclaimer, these corrections are not an affirmation of any particular person’s position. These are just clarifications for the sake of mathematical accuracy.

21:30 “Let’s just take something everybody knows like multiplicative commutativity. A times B = B times A. … There are situations where this doesn’t apply, such as matrices.”

Matrix products are NOT multiplication, they are a shorthand for function composition akin to
. This is because from Linear Algebra, we know that any finite dimensional linear transformation can be represented by a matrix, and it turns out that we have discovered a cool pattern for composing these linear transformations in the form of matrices, and we call this pattern “matrix multiplication”.
This is in NO WAY related to the operation “multiplication” and no one should ever expect that it follows the same rules of multiplication proper. What Crocoduck has done here is taken an operation that ISN’T multiplication, interpreted literally an analogous linguistic device (a bad one, pedagogically, if this is how people will interpret it), declared that the analogous device doesn’t behave literally like the thing it’s analogous to, and confirmed that there must be a contradiction afoot and so the rules aren’t “really” rules and so everything is just a linguistic device all along.
 

23:57 *Discussion about Linear Algebra and Quantum Mechanics

I’d just like to point out here that Linear Algebra was not invented TO DESCRIBE quantum mechanics. Linear Algebra was its own field of study, proving theorems in its own right, for its own reasons, and it JUST SO HAPPENED to be a good fit for Quantum Mechanics, as did other branches of math. There’s more to Lie Algebras than just Linear Algebra, let me assure you.

24:25 *Discussion about Non-Euclidean Geometry / Differential Geometry.

Here’s a nontechnical description of Differential Geometry. We live on Earth, an Earth is a sphere. When we get really zoomed in on the world, it looks flat. We have flat ground, flat tables, and so on. Due to this “flatness” we can do Euclidean-Geometry, the parallel postulate holds and so on. But if we zoom way far out, the surface of the Earth is curved (as captains knew for centuries) and so Geometry behaves very differently. The sum of the angles in a triangle are more than 180 degrees and so on.
Differential Geometry contextualizes Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries in a coherent system that explains their application by describing objects called Manifolds. Manifolds are collections of points who, when zoomed out, are governed by a Non-Euclidean Geometry, such as a Sphere. When zoomed in, in Math we say “there exists a local neighborhood for each point such that…”, then the Geometry local to that point in that neighborhood becomes Euclidean. As you can see, Euclidean and Non-Euclidean Geometries aren’t contradictory. They’re different contexts for examining a set of points and can be contained in a coherent theory. Contradictions cannot be contained in any theory.
His discussion of “you have to change the underlying axioms” is patently false. What you have to do, is come up with a more universal set of axioms which admit both sets of axioms as special cases, as Differential Geometry does very well. These rules are not mutually contradictory.
To anyone who understands these details at a technical level, Crocoduck’s argument looks something like this:

Sometimes doors are open.
Sometimes doors are closed.
A door being open is inconsistent with a door being closed.
Therefore there really is no such thing as a “door” but rather a linguistic device which we use to describe some sort of reality that has nothing to do with a door.

His bit about Non-Euclidean Geometry really exactly as retarded as this argument here. Logics, I might be swayed to believe are linguistic devices. But objects constructed from them end up having immutable properties that impose on the wielder in a way the wielder cannot get out of unless they fundamentally change the logic. In math terms there’s a great example of this.
We have this branch of mathematics called Galois Theory which discusses the underlying structure of the solutions to polynomial equations in terms of Group Theory. From this (And the Abel-Ruffini Theorem prior) we have that general polynomials of degree 5 or higher do not have algebraic formulas for general solutions in the vein of, say, the quadratic formula. Not only have we not found one, we know IN PRINCIPLE they CANNOT have one.
How does this make sense if math is a language? If polynomials are linguistic artifacts, we could change them as malleably as we change our language to say whatever our language needs them to say. But we cannot. We can build something else to do what needs to be done, but that something else will not be a polynomial.
Given this example of polynomials, I conclude with one final analogy:
We invented this thing to hold together wood called a “nail” but had a hell of a time pounding them into the wood. So we invented this thing called a hammer. The hammer was great at pounding in the nail but was terrible at being used to eat soup. This is because the hammer we made, despite being invented as a tool originally, was really a hammer. Being a real hammer, it had a set of mind independent facts about what it can and cannot do in the world which come with a set of mind independent consequences about what we can use the hammer for.
Analogously with mathematics, we invent things called operations or sets to describe some real world thing. Maybe our motivation for investigating them in the first place IS to make them our tool for some problem about physical reality. But then we investigate the tools we derive further and find out that they yield more abstract and complex objects such as polynomials or manifolds. Those objects, it turns out, have invariant and defining properties that we can’t muck with while keeping the structure of the object intact in the same way that disassembling the hammer makes it no longer a hammer.
Those properties which impose restrictions on us, the users, in a way language proper does not and cannot in principle, reflect the realness of the objects under construction. It’s no secret that we spend decades discovering the properties of mathematical objects IN THEMSELVES before they end up becoming useful to physicists later. This is because using an object is different from knowing what an object IS.

Science and Spirituality: of course they go together and always have. But much modern Science Fiction deals with spirituality generally and religion specifically very poorly, which hurts the quality of the fiction and removes much of the human element. How can you do spirituality–not just Christian spirituality but ANY spirituality–effectively in fiction, even if you aren’t religious? Brian, Declan, Max, and Tiger discuss.

Title: The Rational Male: alpha kings, beta slaves & female hypergamists
Author: OdaStOda
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/03/07/the-rational-male-alpha-kings-beta-slaves-female-hypergamists/
Category: Essays
Date: March 7, 2018
Entry: 
While looking at various Youtube videos on the MGTOW lifestyle, I accidentally ran into 21 Studios, a men’s self-improvement channel, featuring numerous and rather entertaining lectures on masculinity, self-esteem and dating. Speakers included Rollo Tomassi, author of “The Rational Male“, a book that intrigued me because of the enthusiastic feedback of its readers, ranging from men who were considering suicide after a failed relationship to concerned mothers seeking sound dating advice for their sons.
Women as hypergamous “relationship hoppers”
Rollo Tomassi’s book, “The Rational Male” is based on the premise that women are naturally ‘hypergamous’ creatures, i.e.  unfaithful relationship hoppers, constantly looking for another man who better meets their material and sexual requirements. According to Rollo Tomassi, women’s libido increases when competing with other attractive females for the  same exceptional male. Likewise, their sexual appetite and attractiveness decreases, when they feel secure in a long-term relationship. In order to assure men of a regular sex life, Rollo Tomassi recommends that they artificially place their partners in an atmosphere of competition with other women. Tomassi not only recommends this in the dating stage, where men are advised to maintain several non-exclusive relationships, which can be shifted around according to their sexual needs ( “turning plates”). He also encourages men to continue maintaining a spirit of competition for their wives after a long-term relationship is established.  The purpose is to maintain women in a subtle atmosphere of uncertainty, so they will keep investing into their relationship, by staying attractive and providing their man with regular sex.
Beta male behavior is detrimental to the female libido
Tomassi’s view on women is rather one-dimensional. He seems to have little use for them, except as interchangeable providers of sexual pleasure and offspring. He also warns his readers against ‘One-itis’ the idea that there is a special soulmate out there for everyone. According to Tomassi, there is no such thing as a unique soulmate. Soulmates are a female construct, aimed at making men compliant to their imperative, i.e. being the devoted, caring ‘Beta male’ or ‘nice guy’ who sacrifices everything for his love interest. A lot of Beta males try to be a woman’s ‘best friend’, because they mistakenly believe that this would make them sexually appealing to her. Unfortunately, these ‘Beta males’, according to Tomassi, are not rewarded for their efforts. On the contrary. Because they place their woman in a secure position, Beta males unintentionally kill their partner’s libido, eventually losing her to that dark, mysterious stranger,  who will satisfy her competitive, hypergamous nature. This explains why women often leave perfectly good providers to have affairs with their sexy personal trainer or that mysterious player who turns out to be a total jerk.
Men need to ‘unlearn’ beta male behavior to cope with hypergamous femininity
So what are men to do? According to Tomassi, Beta males or ‘nice guys’ need to ‘unlearn’ their feminized behavior to become what women really want: the independent, self-assured, elusive and completely unapologetic ‘alpha male’. The ‘Alpha male’ is the ‘Beta male’s’ opposite in terms of following women’s imperative. For the ‘Alpha’, women’s preferences are not a priority: there is only his way or the highway. He’s the top dog, the ambitious leader, the rogue, the man who does not need to explain himself to attract women in droves. The alpha male is neither good nor evil. He can be a top executive or a gang leader, an artist or golden boy, a rough biker or that sexy pool boy. Ultimately, it’s not his social status that really counts, but his attitude of mystery and independence. Women are always revolving around him, so when one of them leaves, there is always another to replace her. Alpha males do not get dumped like the wretched Betas. And if they do, it never brings them the same devastation. The alpha male is very much like the hypergamous female: always looking for the best option for themselves, putting their egos at the very top of their priorities.
Where I agree with Rollo Tomassi
1. Submissive ultra-Beta males are not sexy

While most women want husbands,  who are their best friends, supportive partners and tender lovers, they also want their men to command respect both within the family and society.  This has everything to do with the role of men as providers and protectors. To find out whether a man is a good protector, women ‘shit test’ his loyalty and strength. Why? Because a man, who is unable to stand up to his woman,  is going to have an even harder time dealing with the many other challenges of life (both professional and personal). The last thing women want is another problem child to worry about. They want a strong protector to stand beside them and to raise children with, not a push over or a liability.
2.  Myth of the soulmate
Under the influence of the media and the ‘female’ imperative according to Tomassi, a lot of people believe in the myth that there is a special Soulmate out there for everyone, also known as ‘The One’. Nothing is further from the truth. Actually, there are numerous compatible partners out there for each and every one of us. A separation does not mean that your life is over and that you’ll never find a suitable partner again.
3. Myth of women as ‘perfect snowflakes’
A lot of men tend to have unrealistically high expectations of women and relationships, often to their detriment. It goes without saying that women are fallible human beings, not morally superior angels or goddesses. Putting women on a pedestal is not conducive to a healthy, balanced relationship and will almost certainly lead to disappointment and heartbreak for men.
4.  Don’t reveal all your secrets and vulnerabilities right away
No one is perfect and people do make mistakes. However, it is a bad idea to reveal all your ‘dirty secrets’ during the early relationship, especially if they are not representative of your personality. Don’t reveal your past partner count or other embarrassing details you’d rather not share on a date. A certain level of mystery does contribute to your sex appeal. It’s a myth that ‘being yourself’ will help you score with women. Also, you’re not necessarily misrepresenting yourself if you put your best foot forward.
5. Never shack up or buy a home with a woman who is not your wife 
Tomassi’s reasoning behind this is that cohabitation not only makes it impossible for men to see other women (i.e. no opportunity to ‘shift plates’), but also decreases a woman’s libido due to the lack of competition. I agree with him that unmarried cohabitation is an inferior arrangement, compared to real marriage. In many cases, it is a band-aid against loneliness and sexual starvation, a trap which prevents men and women from achieving their genuine professional and personal goals.
Points where I don’t agree with Rollo Tomassi
1. All women, without exception, are potential hypergamists + Women are incapable of the same type of love as men
Although studies indicate that women tend to ‘marry up’ (the original meaning of the word hypergamy), in order to secure material well-being for themselves and their children, constantly ‘shopping around’ for wealthier and more exciting men seems like a very stressful activity for them to engage in. I have no doubt that there are women who will use any opportunity for instant gratification, especially in our current consumerist culture. However, constantly changing her affective and social environment is not conducive to a woman’s procreational and emotional need for stability. Also, cultural and religious norms do tend to civilize women’s  basic instinctual drives, very much like they do for men.
Finally, although Tomassi writes that men and women have a different definition and perception of love, he does not manage to explain this claim in a convincing way. Do men really love for love’s sake, while women’s love is conditional and based on their hypergamic nature?  I doubt there is any serious evidence to back this theory.
2. Maintaining competition stimulates the female libido
Competition can be exciting, but too much of it can be experienced as a threat. While a subtle atmosphere of insecurity and sexual competition, may force a woman to invest more into her (sexual) relationship, this could also backfire and actually encourage her to broaden her options, just in case hubby runs off with a ‘slimmer, younger model’. That brings me to the following question: isn’t the male quest for ever more beautiful women indicative of a masculine version of hypergamy? What does this say about men’s capacity to ‘love for love’s sake’? To answer these questions, is to know the answer.
3. If a woman won’t have sex with a man after three dates, he should stop seeing her
Because Tomassi believes that all women, regardless of their self-declared principles, will have sex when placed under the right circumstances,  he encourages men to stop seeing women who delay the sexual part of their relationship. Why wait for any woman, since they’ll all agree to have a one night stand with the first alpha male jerk who gets them into the right mood? In Tomassi’s eyes, all women are sluts and if they are not, it’s merely due to a lack of opportunity or sex appeal. This seems like a very cynical, not to say misogynistic  (and I don’t use this word lightly) opinion of women. This is very similar to the claim that all men would be sex fiends and rapists, if they were given the opportunity. Such generalizations tend to be very damaging to gender relations.
Conclusion: 
In his book ‘The Rational Male’, Rollo Tomassi paints a very bleak picture of women, men and their sexuality. Humans are slaves to their most basic instincts in a hedonistic and basically loveless world. If men feel the need to leash the hypergamous, sociopathic ‘nature’ of women, doesn’t that make them loveless sociopaths in the same process? An alternative solution may be the use of sex bots: female androids with bionic vaginas. For Mr. Tomassi and his fans, this may actually be the most sanitary and painless route away from the hell of “hypergamy”.

Liberalists aren’t liberal. Just incoherent. Liberalist Stream #1: Their Supposed “Principles” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaoPi… 2:25 – 2:42 (Individuals own themselves, government protects their rights so that they may be free) 2:47 – 3:13 (An explicit list of what individual rights are by Sargon)
20:00 – 20:18 (Our critics at the Kumite aren’t for anything, they only define themselves as what they’re against)
22:10 – 22:53 (Your property is yours and no one has a right to take it from you, but taxation is not theft)
22:59 – 23:15 (What is taxed is effectively public property) 25:03 – 25:40 (Dude, where’s my rights?)
26:55 – 27:05 (A human right is the consequence of a principle, not a principle itself)
27:27 – 27:35 (Rights are things we give ourselves, we determine what is a human right) —
Post-stream, here are what we think Liberalist principles are:
1: Absolute beliefs are absolutely bad and must be avoided.
2: There is no God (we absolutely “lack belief” that there is anything intelligent running the universe)
3: Religion is bad and dangerous
4: Religious people are dangerous and should be told to shut up and keep their ideas out of their own governance.
5: Except where it conflicts with 1-4, you should have absolute individual autonomy. (Read “We” and Plato’s Republic)

Lying about Hitler, “Essence of Sophistry” would be a better name for this guy.

And science. And pretty much everything else.

According to a Pew Research Center 2014 telephone survey, a majority of the public says science and religion often conflict, with nearly six-in-ten adults (59%) expressing this view in newly released findings from a Pew Research Center survey. The share of the public saying science and religion are often in conflict is up modestly from 55% in 2009, when Pew Research conducted a similar survey on religion and science. In addition, some atheists, like Jerry Coyne, have been loudly and publicly insisting that a battle between religion and science exists. Coyne resists any accommodation between religious and non-religious scientists to defend Darwinism. He doesn’t want to see them joining forces against the creationist common enemy in case that legitimises religion. In order for his position to make sense, he needs to show that there is some sort of existential conflict between religion and science.
Nevertheless, the people’s sense that this conflict exists between religion and science seems to have less to do with their own religious beliefs than it does with their perceptions of other people’s beliefs. Less than one third of Americans polled in the new survey (30%) say their personal religious beliefs conflict with science, while fully two-thirds (68%) say there is no conflict between their own beliefs and science.
Atheists seem to endlessly trot out the trope of the incompatible relationship between science and Christian religion. For example, public atheists like Jerry Coyne have been loudly and publicly insisting that a battle between religion and science exists. Coyne resists any accommodation between religious and non-religious scientists to defend Darwinism. He doesn’t want to see them joining forces against the creationist common enemy in case that legitimises religion. In order for his position to make sense, he needs to show that there is some sort of existential conflict between religion and science.
Let us repeat: Jerry Coyne doesn’t want Christians helping defend Evolution. He considers them an enemy even if they agree with him.
This is only possible through reinforcing a mistaken notions mutual antagonism, inherent conflict, and aggressive warfare created by John Wiliam Draper and Andrew Dickson White. Their books painted history as an endless conflict between the rationality of science (earnestly searching for truth) opposed by the ignorance of religion (stubbornly trying to block scientific progress), with science fighting valiantly and continually emerging victorious. It is by design that those two books; (‘A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom’, by Andrew White, and ‘History of the Conflict between Religion and Science’, by John Draper) are available for free downloading at Infidels.org and PositiveAtheism.org, respectively. It is undoubtedly also by design that those two sites do not provide links to any of the many scholarly sources offering devastating criticisms of the works of White and Draper.
The fictional portrayal of history by Draper and White is dramatic, with heroes and villains clearly defined, and therefore appealing for many people. Their colorful stories of “science vs. religion” mainly center on ‘flat earth’ and the Galileo controversy are useful for anti-Christian (and anti-religious via broad-brush tactics) rhetoric, and has exerted a powerful influence on popular views about the interactions between science and religion. However, the stories portrayed by Draper and White are rejected by modern historians as highly over-simplified and inaccurate in their description of what really happened.
For instance, people today accept the notion that, in the time of Columbus, educated Christians believed the earth was flat. However, the truth is the reverse. This wrong idea is due to a fascinating abuse of history that began around 1830 when two writers (a creative novelist inventing a colorful story about Columbus, and an atheist scholar trying to make Christians look foolish) collaborated to invent a false story about “belief in a flat earth”. The story was later popularized by Draper’s book. ‘The Myth of Flat-Earth Belief.’
The same fallacious misinformation portrays the Galileo affair consistently and simplistically as a battle between science and Christianity (all religion by extension); a notable episode in the long warfare of science and theology. The narrative ignores that the conflict was located as much within the church (between opposing theologies of biblical interpretation) and within science (between alternative cosmologies both inside and outside the Church) as between “science and the church.”
The fact of the matter is this popular historical canard has everything going for it except objectivity, rationality, and impartiality. For example, Galileo was never “imprisoned.” He was merely temporarily confined to a villa in Florence for violating an agreement he had made with the Pope. He was never asked to “recant his scientific assertions that the Earth revolves around the Sun.” The Church had already accepted the feasibility of Copernicus’ heliocentric cosmology. The pope who was sideways with Galileo was a Copernicus fan, as were the majority of the Catholic scientists at the time.
The issue between Galileo and the Pope was not whether it was acceptable to assert that the earth revolved around the sun. The issue was the assertion (which Copernicus never made but Galileo did) that there was sufficient scientific evidence to prove it, which, at the time, there wasn’t. Therefore, Galileo was not in trouble because of ‘his’ science, he was in trouble due to breach of trust (with someone who just so happened to be the Pope).
Atheist/Anti-theist activists seem to be fully invested in the belief that they (Atheist/Anti-Theist) are considerably smarter and more capable than religious people. It may have appeared that they had the proof they wanted in the study “Judgments About Fact and Fiction by Children From Religious and Nonreligious Backgrounds” by Kathleen H. Corriveaua, Eva E. Chenb and Paul L. Harris. The study was originally published in Cognitive Science (2014) 1–30; 1551-6709 online DOI: 10.1111/cogs.12138.
The abstract describes the research as two studies of 5- and 6-year-old children who were questioned about the status of the protagonist embedded in three different types of stories. In realistic stories that only included ordinary events, all children, irrespective of family background and schooling, claimed that the protagonist was a real person. In religious stories that included ordinarily impossible events brought about by divine intervention, claims about the status of the protagonist varied sharply with exposure to religion. Children who went to church or were enrolled in a parochial school, or both, judged the protagonist in religious stories to be a real person, whereas secular children with no such exposure to religion judged the protagonist in religious stories to be fictional. Children’s upbringing was also related to their judgment about the protagonist in fantastical stories that included ordinarily impossible events whether brought about by magic (Study 1) or without reference to magic (Study 2). Secular children were more likely than religious children to judge the protagonist in such fantastical stories to be fictional. The results suggest that exposure to religious ideas has a powerful impact on children’s differentiation.
Some articles published in the popular press in the wake of this study’s release seem almost jubilant. Huffington Post writer Shadee Ashtari states that, “In both studies, [children exposed to religion] were less likely to judge the characters in the fantastical stories as pretend, and in line with this equivocation, they made more appeals to reality and fewer appeals to impossibility than did secular children,” the study concluded.
While that paragraph is accurate, she carries it further than the study does by stating “Refuting previous hypotheses claiming that children are “born believers,” the authors suggest that “religious teaching, especially exposure to miracle stories, leads children to a more generic receptivity toward the impossible, that is, a more wide-ranging acceptance that the impossible can happen in defiance of ordinary causal relations.”
Examples of the stories were cited at http://www.bbc.com/news/blogs/echochambers:
Three Joseph stories
Religious: “This is Joseph. Joseph was sent to a mean king in a land far away. However, God sent Joseph many dreams warning about terrible storms, and Joseph used those dreams to tell the king how to protect his kingdom from the storms. The king was so amazed by Joseph and they became friends.”
Fantastical: “This is Joseph. Joseph was sent to a mean king in a land far away where there were terrible storms. Joseph used his magical powers to see into the future, and told the king how to protect his kingdom from the storms. The king was so amazed by Joseph and they became friends.”
Realistic: This is Joseph. Joseph was sent to a mean king in a land far away where there were terrible storms. The king realised that Joseph was very good at looking at clouds and predicting when there would be rain. The king was so amazed by Joseph and they became friends.”
Joseph Stern of Slate.com begins by telling the readers, “In the United States, conventional wisdom holds that you should raise your child to be religious. Taking the kids to church is the default; leaving them home requires justification. Push parents to explain why they should pass on their religion—apart from a principled urge to keep the faith—and they’re likely to tell you studies prove that kids do better with religion than without it.” This is followed by a paragraph informing us that several studies do seem to corroborate the assertion that kids raised with religious beliefs are psychologically healthier than kids raised without it. The gap is small but real. Some researchers link religious affiliation and regular church attendance with a mild boost in children’s mental health. There is also belief that those same children have better self-control and react better to discipline.
However, he later ties religion to damage caused by arguments over religion, while ignoring that the damage is caused by discord between their parents, just like arguments over money, mental health, etc., and attempts to question the causality of the difference. He cites John Bartkowksi, a professor of sociology at University of Texas at San Antonio, who wonders whether church attendance really leads to good behavior—or whether it might be the other way around. “It may be that kids who are already well-behaved are the only ones who can get into religious communities. It may be that kids who are already well-behaved are the only ones who can get into religious communities” These statements presumes that self-control leads to attendance at religious services, rather than the other way around.
Any regular attendant to church, temple or family mosque will readily attest that this presumption is patently false. Small children are sources of disruption and noise in virtually any worship service. Small children bore easily and quickly, their tolerance for religious ceremonies is low. They learn discipline/self-control from their parents modeling, teaching and enforcing discipline when and where it is appropriate.
To his credit, even after tying religion to ‘fantastical’ miracle stories and speculating that these stories confuse the minds of 3-6 year olds, Stern does cover the weaknesses of the researchers’ argument. Citing Paul Bloom, a professor of psychology at Yale. Bloom called the paper, “a cool study by a sharp research team,” but notes that most kids, religious or secular, are pretty good at distinguishing fantasy from reality.” Bloom told the writer that “…children only look incompetent when dealing with the stories of clever psychologists.”
Bloom states that all children are exposed to seemingly incredible things that also happen to be true on a daily basis. Though the Slate article lists only evolution and plate tectonics as items that can force them to re-evaluate their perceptions of reality, there are innumerable others. Even familiar things such as television, CD/DVDs, airplanes and so on cause dramatic shifts in, or expansion of perception of, reality. Though death is quite mundane and accepted in society; a child struggles with the fact that a familiar person or a pet is gone forever shakes their world profoundly.
In the end, though, Bloom states, “The problem with certain religious beliefs isn’t that they are incredible (science is also incredible) and isn’t that they ruin children’s ability to distinguish between fantasy and reality. It’s that they are false.”
This writer questions Bloom’s declarative presumption that religious stories are false. He has made a global, sweeping statement with no basis in fact; no research or studies have been cited. He would not presume to make any such far-reaching statement about human psychological research with no research finding, what makes religion so different?
On the other side of the debate, EchoChambers cites individuals who see the findings from this study as positive. The following citations are either lifted directly or paraphrased from the article.
“This study proves a benefit of religion, not a detriment, because research shows how imaginative and fictional thinking, fantasy play aid in the cognitive development of children,” Eliyahu Federman said in USA Today. “Raising children with fantastical religious tales is not bad after all.” “Those claiming that belief in religious stories harms children should be interpreting research and science correctly,” he says, adding,”Not only is there benefit in allowing children to think imaginatively without forcing them into the mindset of perceived reality, but according to at least one study, raising children with religion also increases self-esteem, lowers anxiety, risk of suicide, alcohol and drug abuse, and dangerous sexual behavior.”
“Are we really going to say that kids who are taught to believe the Bible is true are somehow developmentally delayed because they’re more likely, at age 5 or 6, to believe fantastical things?” Jenny Erikson for the Stir asked. “Flip side to this equation could be that secular kids are taught to lose their sense of wonder and imagination at an earlier age than their Bible-believing friends.”
Prosblogion’s Helen De Cruz says that while there may be some truth to the results, what the study really shows is that the religious children know their Bible stories. “The Bible characters are presented to them as historical, so of course they would be more likely to judge them as historical than children who didn’t hear about these characters,” she writes.
She says the subject deserves further study before drawing conclusions. For instance, would children exposed to scientific study at a young age be more inclined to believe pseudoscientific claims? Would Christian children be more likely to believe miracle narratives from other religions?
A serious study of the global scientific community provides further evidence that the perceived conflict between science and religion is an illusion. Elaine Howard Ecklund founding director of Rice University’s Religion and Public Life Program and the Herbert S. Autrey Chair in Social Sciences and fellow Rice researchers Kirstin Matthews and Steven Lewis collected information from 9,422 respondents in eight regions around the world: France, Hong Kong, India, Italy, Taiwan, Turkey, the U.K. and the U.S. They also traveled to these regions to conduct in-depth interviews with 609 scientists, the largest worldwide survey and interview study ever conducted of the intersection between faith and science.
The study’s results challenge longstanding assumptions about the science-faith interface. While it is commonly assumed that most scientists are atheists, the global perspective resulting from the study shows that this is simply not the case.
“More than half of scientists in India, Italy, Taiwan and Turkey self-identify as religious,” Ecklund said. “And it’s striking that approximately twice as many ‘convinced atheists’ exist in the general population of Hong Kong, for example, (55 percent) compared with the scientific community in this region (26 percent).”
The researchers found that the scientists surveyed were generally less religious than a given general population. Two exceptions to this general trend were in Hong Kong and Taiwan where: 39% of scientists identified as religious versus 20% in the general population, and 54% of scientists identified as religious versus 44 percent of the general population, respectively.
Ecklund noted that only a minority of scientists in each regional context believe that science and religion are in conflict. In the U.K. only 32% of scientists characterized the science-faith interface as one of conflict. This number was only 29 percent in the US. In addition, 25 percent of Hong Kong scientists, 27 percent of Indian scientists and 23 percent of Taiwanese scientists believed science and religion can coexist and be used to help each other
“Science is a global endeavor,” Ecklund said. “And as long as science is global, then we need to recognize that the borders between science and religion are more permeable than most people think.”
Albert Einstein’s religious views were more akin to Thomas Jefferson’s deism than traditional Judaism. Nevertheless, he certainly saw no conflict between science and religion. In his essay, Religion and Science, he clearly states; “Yet it is equally clear that knowledge of what is does not open the door directly to what should be. One can have the clearest and most complete knowledge of what is, and yet not be able to deduct from that what should be the goal of our human aspirations. Objective knowledge provides us with powerful instruments for the achievements of certain ends, but the ultimate goal itself and the longing to reach it must come from another source.”
Later in the same essay, Einstein adds, “A person who is religiously enlightened appears to me to be one who has, to the best of his ability, liberated himself from the fetters of his selfish desires and is preoccupied with thoughts, feelings, and aspirations to which he clings because of their super-personal value.”…“Accordingly, a religious person is devout in the sense that he has no doubt of the significance and loftiness of those super-personal objects and goals which neither require nor are capable of rational foundation.”
The only conflict Einstein sees between science and religion is when a religious community insists on the absolute truthfulness of all statements recorded in the Bible. This means an intervention on the part of religion into the sphere of science; this is where the struggle of the Church against the doctrines of Galileo and Darwin belongs. On the other hand, representatives of science have often made an attempt to arrive at fundamental judgments with respect to values and ends on the basis of scientific method, and in this way have set themselves in opposition to religion.”
In summary, it appears that Einstein believed that science was the realm that provided the tools that enabled humanity to do things. (To many Christians, the main goal of science is to understand natural processes, thereby increasing our understanding what God has created and our understanding of God through His creation.)
To Einstein (and most theists) the realm of religion and sacred texts provided us with the wisdom to decide whether we should or should not do that thing. He understood that the Bible, Torah or most other sacred texts, for that matter, are not written to be interpreted as literal history. They were written as moral and theological lessons for people of that time and culture. Historic accuracy, as we interpret it (exact dates, times, events, etc.) is sacrificed in favor of bringing the reader closer to God and His will. No Orthodox Jew or Christian believes that Genesis, or any other book of the Bible for that matter, is a literal, accurate account of history. Even though some of the books are historic accounts (stories of Saul and David, the Babylonian captivity, etc.) the authors were more concerned with communicating God’s lessons than anything else.

Title: Guest Blog by philomonty: Nihilism & Thomism Inferences (i.e. Catholicism)
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/02/18/guest-blog-philo-nihilism-thomism-inferences-e-catholicism/
Category: Uncategorized
Date: February 18, 2018
Entry: 
Nihilism is to Thomism (thus, Catholicism) as Satan is to the court of angels in the Book of Job.
There is an inter-meshing between these contradictory points that rests on logical inference. We might say it as this: Certain nihilist propositions are correct as conditionals; however, being conditionals shows that the contrary conclusion to Nihilism is true.
For a common example through Job, God and Satan essentially wager on this: Satan posits that any man, if taken far enough, will break. A contemporary idiom would be “every man has their price.” Is the proposition true? Per Aquinas, it is (Summa, Q. 109). No man can resist sin for long, without grace; every man has a breaking point without God’s grace.
Now some of you may know that I was once a Nihilist. Even with my Nihilistic mindset, I found Thomism attractive and appealing. Not only could it solve the problems of Nihilism, Thomism did so from Nihilism’s own grounds (both belong to the Western Metaphysical Tradition, after all). Namely, as a Thomist and as a Nihilist, I found grounds on which both agreed: Where they differed was on whether the conditionals and inferences were true or not. Indeed, as a Nihilist, I found that Thomism provided far better clarity on Nihilism itself  than Nihilists did.
With that in mind, I am not here to make a case for Nihilism, but  to draw those who, like I once did, find Nihilism to be true away from it by showing the contrary logical inference; likewise, it would also be able to make a case against Atheism (a kind of Pascalian argument), since it has no safeguards against some of the following propositions (and at times, even embraces them), and that the logical conclusion of Atheism is Nihilism:
 
If there is no God, then there is no human nature (Sartre; ‘Existence precedes Essence’); however, there is human nature, therefore there is a God (Summa Q. 93).
Life possesses meaning insofar as Man’s actions aim toward an end which is the good (Summa).
Life has no meaning, for there is no real ‘good’ to be aimed at, and with which our end is death, which is opposed to any form of ‘the good’ (General Nihilism).
We are imprisoned in ‘nothingness’ (Heidegger).
We are imprisoned by ‘nothingness’ insofar as creatures are considered ‘dark’ insofar as they are from nothing [viz., ex nihilo] (Quaestiones disputatae de Veritas, Aquinas, reply to objection 5).
The proper movement of a being that stems from nothingness is to tend toward nothingness; however, [a being that has] nature has a tendency towards the good, which is the same as being, therefore the proper movement of a being is to existence (Quaestiones disputate de Potentia, Objection 16 and reply to objection 16).
There is no such thing as Love, i.e., Charity, for all actions as such derive from some ulterior motive (General Cynicism).
Only through God can Man come to possess Charity; for Charity is a virtue that surpasses Man’s natural limitations (Summa); likewise, certain actions such as almsdeeds only flow forth through Charity properly, wherein Charitable actions possess materially the virtue of Charity, but not formally, such that these actions proceed from a different source [‘ulterior motive’] of either natural light [‘reason’], fear, or gain (Summa, reply to objection 1).
There is no such thing as morality, for there is no such thing as good and evil, and there is no such thing as good and evil for there is no objective measurement of rule [viz., nature], and all things listed as such are subjective and belong only in reference to those respective references, viz., the measurement of good and evil is respective to each being only (General Nihilism).
The measurement of rule is established through one’s nature, by which when one acts in accordance with it, one acts good, and when one acts against it, one acts in an evil manner (Summa).

Conspiracy theories are laughed at culturally–and yet, we know conspiracies are real and that conspiracies happen all the time in politics. In fact if you’ve ever been seriously involved in politics you’ve been in some sort of conspiracy yourself. Mainstream Media is now all but universally mistrusted and even condemned. This leaves us with a question: what sources of information do we trust, and why do we trust them? The MSM is controlled. Independent media is challenging because you don’t know who to trust there either. We’re all stuck with that. And social media’s only a little better, because social media can be used by people who lie, or are delusional… or by people desperately trying get out the truth. Rathergate, Gamergate, Obamagate, QAnon, conspiracy theories in general: how should we really approach information that goes against Mainstream Media and Education Narratives?

Title: Could the universe be anything besides comprehensible?

Could the universe be anything besides comprehensible?
To be comprehensible means to be understandable.
The mind grasps what is comprehended.
If the universe can’t be grasped by our mind, that means what we think we know about the universe isn’t how things are.
All our ideas of how the world work just ain’t so.
Without Providence, there is no reason to think that our beliefs reflect reality.
They could simply model risk properly such that we survive and reproduce.
If that’s the case, the universe isn’t comprehensible.
So it seems clear to me that the universe, in theory, could be incomprehensible.
Is Providence the only thing that can ground comprehensibility?
Meaning Comes From Mind
To be comprehensible is to have meaning that can be grasped by a mind.
As such, meaning has something that grounds its existence.
Let’s define this that grounds meaning as “mind”.
Then there are two options for any meaning in the universe: It comes from human minds, or it comes from other mind.
If it comes from human mind, then we’re not seeing meaning in the universe, but rather playing a game like exquisite corpses, imparting an interpretation of randomness and being fooled by it.
So, if there is meaning to be found in the universe, rather than imbued by our own over-active imaginations, that means that there is an Author, a Creator, which writes that meaning into the universe.

Religious men are insane according to the Honeybadger Brigade and A Voice for Men’s founder. Can they back that up with any science? By what professional standards do they make this diagnosis? Can they explain why treating religious men like they are a threat or are retarded or insane is consistent with a Men’s Human Rights message? Can they explain why ANY man in this conversation is insane or dangerous? We don’t think they can. We think they just hate anyone who believes there’s a God and won’t hate Christians and believing Jews (or non-religious Theists) with them. But we doubt they’ll ever answer any of this honestly, or with any sort of integrity. Because they aren’t human rights advocates. They’re anti-feminists who hate Christians and Jews more than feminists. And that’s all they are. NB: Watch out for any so-called “Christians” who stand by them. Any doing so should come talk to their brother Christians about the concerns here first. Otherwise they’re fakers.

Title: An Outline of Skepticism
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2018/02/01/an-outline-of-skepticism/
Category: Uncategorized
Date: February 1, 2018
Entry: 
Richard H. Popkin at https://www.britannica.com/topic/skepticism. defined Skepticism in western philosophy as “the attitude of doubting knowledge claims set forth in various areas.” Skeptics challenge the adequacy or reliability of these claims by questioning the claims existing knowledge is based upon. Skeptics question whether any such claims really are indubitable or necessarily true. They consistently challenge the purported rational grounds of accepted assumptions. In everyday life, practically everyone is skeptical about some knowledge claims. However philosophical skeptics doubt the possibility of any knowledge beyond that of the contents of directly felt experience.
The original Greek meaning of skeptikos was “an inquirer,” someone who was unsatisfied and still looking for truth. From ancient times till now, skeptics have developed arguments to undermine the contentions of dogmatic philosophers, scientists, and theologians. Those arguments, and their employment against various forms of dogma, have played important roles in shaping both the problems and the solutions offered by western philosophy. As philosophy and science developed, doubts arose about various basic, widely accepted beliefs about the world. In ancient times, skeptics challenged the claims of Plato, Aristotle and their followers, as well as those of the Stoics. During the Renaissance, similar challenges were raised against the claims of Scholasticism and Calvinism. Later skeptics attacked Cartesianism (the system established by René Descartes) and other theories that attempted to justify the scientific revolution initiated by Copernicus, Kepler, and Galileo. Later skeptical offensives were leveled against the theories of Immanuel Kant, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel their followers. Each challenge led to new attempts to resolve the skeptical difficulties. Skepticism, especially since the Enlightenment, has come to mean disbelief-primarily religious disbelief-resulting in the skeptic being likened to the village atheist.
Robert Maynard Hutchins, the dean of Yale Law School, the president of the University of Chicago, and one of the more influential philosophers of education in the 20th century gave a series of lectures in 1951. In those lectures, he identified four intellectual trends that had been absolutely disastrous for modern education. He called these trends “the four horsemen of the philosophical apocalypse.”
“If the object of education is the improvement of men, any system of education that is without values is a contradiction in terms. A system that seeks bad values is bad. A system that denies the existence of values denies the possibility of education. Relativism, scientism, skepticism, and anti-intellectualism, the four horsemen of the philosophical apocalypse, have produced that chaos in education which will end in the disintegration of the West.”
In a January 23, 2017 article Daniel Lattier offered brief descriptions of each of “the four horsemen” and their impact on education:
1) Relativism:
The idea that notions of true and false, right and wrong, are purely subjective. Generally speaking, you can see its impact on education today through the exaltation of “tolerance” as the highest virtue, in addition to the changing of the purpose of education from helping students to pursue truth to the pragmatic goal of making them “college- and career-ready.”
2) Scientism:
The idea that the only true or meaningful knowledge is that gained through science. This has contributed to the significant weakening of the humanities curriculum and the decline of basic reading and writing skills at the expense of STEM education.
3) Skepticism:
For Hutchins, skepticism (related to relativism) referred to the idea that our beliefs are nothing more than “our own moods and humors, or, at the utmost, the local prejudices of our own country.” Therefore, according to this way of thinking, schools in Western countries such as America should not attempt to convince students of the truth of Western principles, or even worse, argue that some of these principles are superior to those of other cultures. Rather, they should simply teach students to “appreciate” other cultures.
4) Anti-Intellectualism:
As Isaac Asimov noted, “The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that ‘my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.’” Hutchins saw anti-intellectualism in the increasing resort to sentimentality in Western culture. Today, one sees it particularly manifested in schools in which students are encouraged to have opinions on matters of which they have little to no knowledge, and that the teacher’s job is merely to “affirm” these opinions.
Lattier stated, “These pernicious ideas have grown in strength since Hutchins wrote in 1951.” The four horsemen (harbingers of “the disintegration of the West”) of the “philosophical apocalypse” now permeate most public and private schools ranging from early childhood to even the most prestigious universities.
One need only observe the rise of (utopian) grievance groups such as modern activist feminists, Black Lives Matter and Antifa in recent years to see the effects of this permeation. The groups’ reigning narratives are strictly focused on the specific, personal perception of the aggrieved. These perceptions seem disconnected from the reality of cohesive logic and/or objective fact. This disconnect (and the groups’ members’ unwillingness to discuss or debate it) gives testimony to the power of methodical, systemic skepticism (as described by Hutchins), coupled with dogmatic devotion to the group’s particular ideology (see definition b of Idea, below.)
Another indication of the intellectual decay caused by the ‘four horsemen’ and their disciples is the deviation of ‘Skeptics’, particularly ‘internet skeptics’ from their intellectually philosophical forbearers. The true philosophical skeptics questioned everything to determine whether humanity could honestly know the truth about anything. This author refers the reader back to paragraph 2(two) for the meaning of ‘skepsis’ and skeptic.
The core concepts of ancient skepticism are belief, suspension of judgment, criterion of truth, appearances, and investigation. Important notions of modern skepticism such as knowledge, certainty, justified belief, and doubt play no or almost no role. Ancient debates addressed questions that today we associate with epistemology and philosophy of language, as well as with theory of action, rather than specifically with the contemporary topic of skepticism.
Modern skeptical views typically have either an epistemological form (focused on the epistemic status of certain beliefs) or focus instead on questions that are either local or radical. One common variety of modern skepticism concerns our beliefs about the past and argues that such beliefs lack positive epistemic status – that they are either not justified, not rational, or cannot constitute knowledge (perhaps two or even all three). Where skepticism does not have this epistemological focus, then it tends to be of an ontological form in that it is directed at beliefs about the existence of some supposedly problematic entity, such as the self or God. Here the target of the skepticism is not so much one’s putative knowledge of these entities (though it may be that as well), but rather the claim that they exist at all.
Local varieties of skepticism will only concern beliefs about a certain specific subject matter, such as beliefs in abstract objects or the conclusions of inductive arguments. Since ontological varieties of skepticism tend to be concerned with the existence of particular sorts of entities, they are usually (though not always) of this local form. In contrast, radical forms of skepticism afflict most of our beliefs and thus pose, at least potentially, the most pressing philosophical challenge.
The modern ‘skeptic’ community (both online and offline) grew out of Humanism and atheism, which established themselves as social movements in the mid-19th century. Some skeptics describe themselves as “joyfully debunking others’ outlandish truth-claims.” One universal is that skeptic can be, and often is, interchangeable with ‘atheist/antitheist’. Self-described as “…a remarkably successful informal learning movement, which has proved that people want to spend their leisure-time learning, discussing ideas and socializing.”
The growth of the ‘skeptic community’ has produced large and well-funded Skeptic organizations like the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry and the James Randi Educational Foundation. Calling themselves ‘freethinkers’ ‘rationalists’ or ‘scientistic’, they have morphed into political (see ‘The Geek Manifesto’) and social activists who seemingly have a single-minded drive to abolish religion as evidenced by poorly researched/plagaristic and dogmatic skeptic books by Christopher Hitchens, Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Jon Ronson and Richard Wiseman topping the bestseller list.
Perhaps the most telling trait of the ‘Skeptic Communities’ is their pathologic adherence to atheist dogma (in direct contradiction to their self-anointed label of skeptic/freethinker). Paul Kurtz, the founder of the movement, resigned “under duress” from CSICOP (by then called the Centre for Scientific Inquiry) after protesting against the organization’s “mean-spirited ridicule and criticism” of religion, including its sponsorship of ‘Blasphemy Day’. Under both the Classical and Contemporary definitions of ‘Skepticism’, it is nearly impossible to solidly adhere to any idea beyond “I don’t know.”
The philosophical definitions of an Idea are:
a) A concept developed by the mind.
b) A conception of what is desirable or ought to be; an ideal.
c) Platonism; .Also called form. An archetype or pattern of which the individual objects in any natural class are imperfect
copies and from which they derive their being.
d) Kantianism; Idea of pure reason. (1. Any of the three undemonstrable entities (a personal soul, a cosmos, and a supreme
being) implicit in the fact of a subject and an object of knowledge, and in the need for some principle uniting them.
The dogmatic adherence by certain groups to one or more of Hutchins’ ‘four horsemen’ ideologies has produced chaos in all Western societies. The chaos may largely be due to the groups’ rejection of the basic principles and ideals that are responsible for building and maintaining Western Civilization. The activists reject the free, advanced societies that allow them the freedom to reject and protest. Such cognitive dissonance is possible only if the activists have rejected the notion of objective Truth (below) in favor of Relativism (see above), as well as the other ‘horsemen’.
The definitions of Truth {trooth z, troths}
1. The true or actual state of a matter: He tried to find out the truth.
2. Conformity with fact or reality; verity: the truth of a statement.
3. A verified or indisputable fact, proposition, principle, or the like: mathematical truths.
4. The state or character of being true.
5. Actuality or actual existence.
6. An obvious or accepted fact; truism; platitude.
7. Honesty; integrity; truthfulness.
For many, truth simply means that the ideas of the mind correspond with the reality outside of the person. This concept of truth can be traced back to Aristotle and Plato. It is more recently by St. Thomas Aquinas’ balanced formula “equation of thing and intellect.” His inclusion of the material was intended to leave room for the idea that “true” can be applied not only to thoughts and judgments but also to things or persons (e.g. a true friend). Since the Renaissance, philosophers have paid little attention to the correspondence theory. By that time, it was considered too obvious to merit much attention. However they did spell out a psycho-semantic connection between ideas and the parts of the physical world ‘connected’ to those same ideas.
Object-based correspondence became the norm through Plato’s pivotal engagement with the problem of falsehood. Only things that are show up in this account (eg, Robin flying): in the case of falsehood, (Robin sleeping) the ascribed state still is, but it is a state different from the one of reality. The account is extended from speech to thought and belief via Plato’s well known thesis that “thought is speech that occurs without voice, inside the soul in conversation with itself.
Fact-based correspondence theories became prominent only in the 20th century. These theories do not presuppose that the truth-bearing items have subject-predicate structure; indeed, they can be stated without any explicit reference to the structure of truth-bearing items. The theory offers an alternative response to the problem of falsehood, a response that may claim to extricate the theory of truth from the limitations imposed on it through the presupposition of subject-predicate structure.
Many correspondence theorists likely consider it inconceivable and/or foolishly brash to insist that something being “true” amounts to “corresponds with a fact”. Some simple forms of correspondence definitions of truth should be distinguished (“iff” means “if and only if”; the variable, “x”, ranges over whatever truthbearers are taken as primary; the notion of correspondence might be replaced by various related notions):
(1) x is true iff x corresponds to some fact;
x is false iff x does not correspond to any fact.
(2) x is true iff x corresponds to some state of affairs that obtains;
x is false iff x corresponds to some state of affairs that does not obtain.
Both forms invoke portions of reality-facts/states of affairs-that are typically denoted by clauses or by sentential gerundives, conditionally dependent upon variable facts/states of affairs. The difference between (2) and (1) is akin to the difference between Platonism about properties (embraces uninstantiated properties) and Aristotelianism about properties (rejects uninstantiated properties)
Definition of Certainty plural certainties
1: something that is certain
2: the quality or state of being certain especially on the basis of evidence
Definition of Perception
1 a: a result of perceiving : observation
b: a mental image : concept
2 obsolete : consciousness
3 a: awareness of the elements of environment through physical sensation
• Color perception
b: physical sensation interpreted in the light of experience
4 a: quick, acute, and intuitive cognition : appreciation
b: a capacity for comprehension
Definition of Reality Plural realities
1: the quality or state of being real
2a (1): a real event, entity, or state of affairs
• his dream became a reality
(2) a: the totality of real things and events
• trying to escape from reality
b: something that is neither derivative nor dependent but exists necessarily
3: television programming that features videos of actual occurrences (such as a police chase, stunt, or natural disaster) –
often used attributively
• reality TV
• in reality: in actual fact
Popular refrains from the online ‘skeptic community’ regarding theism and religion include ‘no scientific evidence’ ‘bronze-age superstitions’ and so on. This writer wonders how, given the definitions for skeptic, truth, idea, perception, certainty and reality established by highly respected sources, the skeptic community can claim to truly know, or be certain of anything? The finest minds of History; from Socrates and Plato to Descartes and on into modernity, have struggled to reason their way to a solid platform of knowing anything with certainty. Some spent their live in that pursuit.
Socrates and other Classical Skeptics (brilliant enough for their writings to survive 2,000+ years) were unable to answer that question. How, then can any of the self-important, self-satisfied internet skeptics know that they are not in a brain-in-a-vat, plugged into the matrix or a simulation program in an advanced AI? How much less are they qualified to declare that there is no Creator?
That they declare it with absolute certainty as proof of their own superiority of intelligence, whether in their channel names, their words or their behavior speaks of vast ignorance. The first thing a true skeptic must absolutely question is their own assumptions biases and the reliability of their sources. The so-called ‘skeptics/freethinkers’ failure to do so, coupled with their obvious egotism, hostility to any who break ranks (such as Paul Kurtz), and hatred of traditional Western Values, especially religion, loudly states that the movement is an absolutist ideological cult. To quiet the autistic screeches about rejecting religion, I ask whether Charles Manson was a religious leader. No, he was not. Nor was Karl Marx, Stalin, Lenin or any of thousands of other personalities who have led millions of people to destruction via dogmatic credos throughout history.

Sargon, you have made numerous false statements about me and my team, and have refused to acknowledge or correct your errors. Some of your statements about me are likely actionable in UK libel court and I would suggest to you that there’s a point where you can no longer call yourself “liberal” when you routinely smear and distort and wreck the reputations of people you don’t even bother talking to. I think you’re no different at all in this regard from a Steve Shives or an Anita Sarkeesian: you bash people, you spread false narratives out of ignorance, and you do your best to smear, malign, and distort your critics, without ever being willing to talk to them face to face or be confronted on your own ideas by your critics. If it’s all a misunderstanding, I invite you to bring the Red Pill Religion team onto a stream to talk about who I really am, who this team of people is, and what we’re really about. We’re not all Catholic, we’re not all even Christian, and we talk all the time with people, including honorable, decent Atheists, like Coach Red Pill, Academic Agent, Keith Preston, and a ton of other pretty cool Atheists. Before I turn the floor over to these young men–they’re all younger than you I believe–let me note that they’re not all American and not all Catholic. And I know a number of British religious people, none could be here but I can arrange for that as well. The truth is, sir, you DO NOT live in an Atheist country. You in fact live in a country full of religious people, and the religious are rising not falling. Including Christianity, which is undergoing a revival in your own country. The question you therefore need to answer is this: If you truly are a liberal sir, how do you plan on getting along with religious people? Because most of us aren’t particularly interested in being degraded and maligned by you. And degrading and maligning us is the OPPOSITE of liberal, tolerant, and inclusive. So, as Dave the Distributist has asked (and you’ve ignored): WHEN will you grow up enough to TALK TO PEOPLE WHO THINK DIFFERENT FROM YOU SIR? I will ask it again: how can you POSSIBLY consider yourself an open-minded liberal and REFUSE to talk to people you criticize and REFUSE to be confronted on your own beliefs? How ARE you different from Steve Shives or Laci Green or Anita Sarkeesian sir? Except that you’re anti- instead of pro-feminist, how are you truly different? You do EVERYTHING you accuse them of. Or you seem to. When will that change? With that I’ll turn it over to the crowd, and I’ll be back to wrap this up. –Max

Title: Atheism and Theism, A Grounding of Ethics
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/12/27/atheism-theism-grounding-ethics/
Category: Atheist Challenges
Date: December 27, 2017
Entry: 
According to the standard dictionary, Ethic (singular) is defined as: The branch of knowledge that deals with moral principles.
Ethics (plural) is defined as follows:  Moral principles that govern a person or groups’ behavior or the conducting of an activity.  Ethics as a subject is the study of what actions we should take, which ones are commendable, which ones we should disapprove of and how we should live our lives.
synonyms: moral code, morals, morality, values, rights and wrongs, principles, ideals, standards (of behavior), value system, virtues, dictates of conscience
The origin of the word begins in late Middle English (denoting ethics or moral philosophy; also used attributively): from Old French éthique, from Latin ethice, from Greek ( hē) ēthikē (tekhnē ) ‘(the science of) morals,’ based on ēthos.
Atheists claim that their “lack of belief” has no ethical ramifications, but they are wrong. Without a grounding in the absolute (as Deists and all religious understand it) there is no possibility of morality outside of subjectivism.
Virtue ethics is a philosophy primarily based on the understanding of Aristotle, who learned from Socrates, a student of Plato.  Because virtue ethics is a quest to understand and live a life of moral character, theists such as Christians, Jews, Muslims and Deists will likely agree in broad strokes, or at least find it a compelling way to understand ethics.  As a character-based approach to morality, virtue ethics assumes that we acquire virtue through practice. By practicing being honest, brave, just, generous, and so on, a person develops an honorable and moral character. According to Aristotle, by honing virtuous habits, people will likely make the right choice when faced with ethical challenges.
To illustrate the difference among three key moral philosophies, ethicists Mark White and Robert Arp refer to the film The Dark Knight where Batman has the opportunity to kill the Joker. White and Arp suggest that Utilitarian Ethics would endorse killing the Joker because taking this one life would save multitudes (Do whatever does the most good/the ends justify the means). Deontologists, on the other hand, would reject killing the Joker simply because it’s wrong to kill (following the fixed rules of morality trumps the results of (in)action). Virtue ethics instead manifests as the character of the person, Batman does not kill because he does not want to be the kind of person who takes his enemies’ lives. 
In this way, virtue ethics helps us understand what it means to be a virtuous human being by giving us a guide for living life without giving us specific rules for resolving ethical dilemmas. The important part of determining the correct actions are the qualities you have as a person. A person who acts with ‘goodness’ (acting with wisdom/forethought, justice, courage and self-mastery) is acting ethically.  By the same token, someone performing bad actions (acting foolishly, unfairly, cowardly, greedily or with vicious intent) is acting unethically according to virtue ethics’ principles.  Virtue Ethics guides a person to take a much longer view that the immediate, or even lifetime gains or losses any action will cause a person.  By looking at the virtue, rather than the advantage, a person considers their own, personal telos, or destination of their life’s journey.
For many (both past and present), life is a journey with no destination. The ancient Greeks described history as an endless cycle of events, perpetually moving but never arriving. Like them, secular humanity drifts anchorless through life, experiencing and responding to each circumstance as it appears on the horizon but never really getting anywhere.
For the theist, however, every event-past, present, and future-moves toward a final goal.  The Creator God that brought the universe into existence, and maintains it in existence, causes all things to work together to accomplish His purpose.  To explain this concept, the New Testament uses the Greek telos, meaning “end, goal, result, completion or fulfillment.”  To each of the Abrahamic Faiths, that destination is ultimately either paradise or perdition. However, all religions offer the promise of some form of afterlife, even if it is as a higher or lower ‘station’ to be reborn in that is awarded according to the objective truth of one’s life’s deeds.
In many respects, to accomplish one’s telos is to live in accordance with the purpose for which you were made.  This coincides with Aristotle’s definition for an entity that performs well or excellently by fulfilling its proper (i.e., essential) function.  Aristotle saw a universal teleology or purposiveness in which everything in the universe was goal-directed and striving to actualize its essence.  For him, an object actualizes its distinctive essence when it achieves an identity of formal and final causation.  Man, as a rational being with free will, should strive for his own perfection.
By achieving his fulfillment and all-around development he would attain happiness or fulfillment (Eudaimonia).  It follows therefore, that in ethics a man should choose actions that are properly ordered with respect to human affairs; a project through which people aspire to happiness through the cultivation of virtues.  Aristotle taught that people acquire virtues (i.e., good habits) through practice and that a set of concrete virtues could lead a person toward his natural excellence and happiness.  Morally good habits promote stable and predictable behavior and foster coordination in an imperfect world.  Habits are born from natural dispositions created through the repetition of actions.  If these habits are morally good, they serve to underpin virtues.
Because the shortcomings of Utilitarianism have become apparent and the concept of referring to an absolute standard of right and wrong is politically incorrect, many have searched for another system of morality.  One such system is Quasi-Utilitarianism, created by Iain King, CBE. Iain is an expert on military history, and has given lectures on war to packed university theatres across Britain. He has worked in ten conflicts around the world, and in 2013 became one of the youngest people ever to be honored with the title ‘Commander of the British Empire’, for his frontline roles in Libya, Afghanistan and Kosovo. He has written acclaimed non-fiction books on modern conflict and philosophy and fiction in the techno-thriller genre.
Iain’s philosophy book, “How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time,” lays out his quasi-utilitarianism philosophy.  After laying out that both Intuitive and Utilitarian Ethics are flawed and untenable in all situations, Iain claims that rethinking ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ from scratch makes us wonder what ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ actually refer to.  This must be done to find what consequences and motives separate ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ in ‘meta-ethics’, which means ‘beyond’ or ‘above’ ethics.  Different philosophers have come to different conclusions on meta-ethics. Some say ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ are absolute qualities in the world perhaps as real as numbers; others say they are little more than personal tastes, or expressions of ‘boo’ and ‘hurray’ in response to what we witness. 
Iain states that ‘How to Make Good Decisions and Be Right All the Time’ sets out four routes for establishing a basis for right and wrong, which also answer ‘What should we do?’ All four routes converge on the same conclusion – the Help Principle: (1) Route One: Reconstructing Utilitarianism, which means reconsidering the common argument for ‘do whatever has the best consequences’ (utilitarianism).  Route Two: ‘Correcting’ John Rawls’ approach by adapting the method of denying self-interest to establish a basis for right and wrong (from ‘A Theory of Justice’, 1971).  Route Three: The Argument from Evolution:  Evolution has instilled moral instincts in us. Because evolution; a chain of our ancestors adapted to their environments, which were arbitrary, this means the genes, and the moral instincts that go with them, which have survived to now are arbitrary too.  Route Four: The ‘Sherlock Holmes’ method states that there may or may not be something of value, or meaning in life.  If there is meaning, it makes sense to seek it; and if there isn’t any meaning in life it doesn’t matter what we do, since there is nothing of value to be lost.  
To define the Help Principle, Iain King says it is necessary to consider the consequences of our actions independently of when we make our decisions because right and wrong should not depend on ‘when’.  The hypothetical impact of choices must be applied to the past as well as the future.  This is important for promises etc.  The Help Principle is reciprocal to be applied to people only as much as they would apply it themselves.  When group members don’t reciprocate help they receive, the Help Principle generates: ‘Choose whichever option brings about the greatest all-time direct benefit’ (close to Utilitarianism, but excluding person-to-person wants and including hypothetical impact on the past happiness).  For the Help Principle to serve as a practical guide to action, it needs to adapt to the real world.  Problems of incomplete information, uncertainty, complexity, inertia, and the impact of previous commitments mean we can rarely make perfect calculations.  Iain states that coping with the inevitable uncertainty, complexity etc. of the real world, we must adopt conventions such as social norms, ‘rules of thumb’, traditions of expected behavior and some institutions.
This move reflects a now-common desire to ground ethics without God or religion.  The secular/atheist activists/influences in our current culture demand that any/all religious influences be eradicated from the public square.  The demand to expunge religion seems to come even if the religious influence has no effect on the culture at large.
Secular rejection of religious basis for ethics may start with the rejection of Pascal’s Wager.  Blaise Pascal offers a pragmatic reason offers a pragmatic reason for believing in God: even under the assumption that God’s existence is unlikely.  The basis Pascal offers for believing is that the reward for believing/punishment for not believing is substantial in the event God does exist; while the negatives are miniscule if God does not exist.  Therefore, it is universally advantageous to believe that God exists.
Pascal’s argument has many objections, including intellectualist objections that one cannot believe something by simply deciding to do so.  While true, this objection has perhaps less weight that at first glance.  No one can do anything simply by virtue of deciding to.  Aristotle, acknowledged doing the right thing is not always so simple, even though few people deliberately choose to develop vicious habits in sharp disagreement with Socrates’s belief that knowing what is right always results in doing it.  The great enemy of moral conduct, on Aristotle’s view, is precisely the failure to behave well even on those occasions when one’s deliberation has resulted in clear knowledge of what is right.  One cannot get to work or school simply by deciding to.  Any/every decision must be followed up with actions and behavior that support and reinforce the decision.
Moral/Ethical Subjectivism holds that there are no objective moral properties and that ethical statements are in fact arbitrary because they do not express immutable truths.  Many modern atheists/materialists claim that moral or ethical statements are made true or false by the attitudes opinion, personal preference feelings and/or conventions of the person speaking.  Thus, for a statement to be considered morally right merely means that it is met with approval by the person of interest.  Another way of looking at this is that judgments about human conduct are shaped by, and in many ways limited to, perception.
An Ethical Subjectivist could argue that the statement “Stalin was evil” expresses a strong dislike for the sorts of things that Stalin did, but it does not follow that it is true (or false) that Stalin was in fact evil. Another person who disagrees with the statement on purely moral grounds (while in agreement with all non-evaluative facts about Stalin) is not making an intellectual error, but simply has a different attitude.
It is compatible with Moral Absolutism, (belief that an individual can be certain that at least some of their moral precepts apply in all situations), but it is also compatible with Moral Relativism (the truth of moral claims is relative to the attitudes of individuals).  Moral/Ethical Subjectivism is a cognitivist theory that holds ethical sentences to be subjective, yet still the kind of thing that can be true or false, depending on whose approval is being discussed. It stands in direct contrast to Moral Realism (under which ethical statements are independent of personal attitudes).
Ethical Subjectivism seemingly provides a simple, common-sense explanation of what morality is.  Though ethical views often give an internal appearance of objectivity (it feels like we are making, or attempting to make, an objective statement), all that means is people believed them to be true, due to the assertive nature of most ethical statements.
Ethical Subjectivism creates significant problems because it offers no way for people engaged in ethical debate to resolve their disagreements.  Instead it requires each side to exercise tolerance by acknowledging the equally ‘factual truth’ of the perceptions asserted by opponents.  This tolerance counteracts the issues ethics seeks to resolve, namely deciding ‘what is the right thing to do’.  In addition, feelings and attitudes often change over time, as knowledge, experience and circumstances change.  Variable foundations and non-judgementalism may serve to insulate one from criticism from their peers, but do not make a good base for ethical decisions.
Subjectivism also leads inevitably to the claim that objective morals don’t exist.  The claim that our universe contains moral categories of values (good and evil) and duties (right and wrong actions) that exist independently of anyone’s opinion and apply to the actions and motivations of all persons is unacceptable to Subjectivists and Atheists alike.  Whether this is because universal rules are inconvenient/restricting or imply the existence of a universal rule-giver (God) is irrelevant.  Therefore, the topic at hand is a question of ontology-whether these categories actually exist, and not epistemology-how we know these categories. How we come to knowledge of morality is irrelevant to the question.  The question is whether these moral categories exist in reality, not in someone’s private belief system.  Neither ignorance of a given law, or claiming you are immune because you do not accept the law are admissible as a defense in court of most ‘civilized’ nations (unless you are of an artificially favored/protected population).
So the question presents us with two different types of realities; a moral universe in which objective moral categories exist, and an amoral universe that contains only subjective moral categories (where each person’s standard of right, wrong, good, and evil is defined by themselves and applies only to themselves).  In order to determine which of these descriptions applies to our own universe, let’s take a look at what both of these realities might be like, and then see which most closely describes the features of our own universe.
In an Amoral Universe, where objective moral categories do not exist, no action can be called objectively evil.  While one might dislike another’s action, no external standard exists by which any action can be called good or evil. In the overall scheme of things, feeding your child is no better or worse than beheading your child, and any feelings one has to the contrary are simply opinion. In this universe, moral opinions have no basis in reality; that is to say, nothing objective exists on which to base such a concept.  The only basis for making such a claim here is just private interests and taste.  When people say “that’s wrong!” they are saying: “That is against my interests/standards/tastes!”
In a Moral Universe, objective moral categories exist as objective features of the universe, and not of an individual human.  Therefore, these categories apply to all humans, just as the law of gravity and laws of physics apply to all physical objects.  The laws of morality are just as binding as natural laws on moral creatures.  However, the moral categories are necessarily different from other laws of the universe in that they are prescriptive (describing how things ought to be) and not descriptive (describing how things are).  Any given action can fall into one of three categories:
Moral actions – actions that conform to the objective moral standard (ex:  Helping someone in need without asking for reward.)
Immoral actions – actions that violate the objective moral standard (ex:  Violating another person’s rights to life, property or person.)
Amoral actions – actions which are not addressed by the objective moral standard (ex:  Parking in the wrong lot without a permit (illegal, but does not violate any moral code) or buying only organic produce.)
The idea of an amoral universe is existentially self-refuting, though not logically self-refuting. There is no logical incoherence in the statement “No objective moral values and duties exist.”  However, when one attempts to describe how one should live in such a universe they automatically invalidate the concept.  In an amoral universe, “how one should live” is meaningless because no standard exists to describe how one should live.
Many find it is easy to claim that “Objective moral truths do not exist; I have the right to do as I please!”  Yet, they are making this statement without considering that it makes a moral claim to a “right” while denying a moral reality.  If you believe that others ought to allow you to live according to the dictates of your own will and your own conscience, then you are appealing to objective morality to justify what others “ought” to do.

Noel Plum hates serious believing Jews and Christians. He only respects primitive Fundamentalists, but he hates them too, and wants to “deconvert” their children. He also admits his goal and the goal of those in his cult network is to convert our children to Atheism and to turn children against their parents. In short, Noel Plum proves Atheism is a malevolent hate movement and a bizarre cult. Join Max and Ghost of Buckley as we respond to his hateful, inaccurate, ideological gibberish.

Entry: 
Currently Steve serves as a Catechist, lay-pastor, at Christ the Redeemer Church – An Anglican Parish is Davis, California. A city known for its progressive-ethic – and hence dubbed the “People’s Republic of Davis” by Rush Limbaugh. Mostly owing to the influence of the University of California at Davis, Davis is known for its liberal and anti-Christian ideology. As of 2014, it was ranked in the top ten percent of the most-liberal of California’s 150 largest cities. Steve converted from Atheism to Christianity as a teenager – initially persuaded to give Christianity a fair shake by the apologetics ministry of Josh McDowell. Steve fell into a world of theistic evidence and logic reading Cornelius Van Til and St. Thomas Aquinas. Steve is also a seminarian at Trinity School for Ministry. His professional work consulting with political campaigns, leading nonprofit organizations, and in the California State Capitol has been recognized by The Los Angeles Times, National Review Magazine, and Our Sunday Visitor. Steve is a postulant in the Anglican Church in North America and leads communications for the Sacramento Valley Deanery. He and his wife Sarah and have four children: Athanasius, Anselm, Assumpta, and Basil.

Title: Sargon of Akkad and his Phony Christian Crew
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/12/05/sargon-akkad-phony-christian-crew/
Category: Essays
Date: December 5, 2017
Entry: 
By Ghost of Buckley
Sargon of Akkad is someone I’ve been a longtime subscriber of. He makes excellent content every now and again, and he is mostly consistent in how he presents his information. The main problem, of course, is his hatred of religion.
Although Sargon will give lip service to Christian groups that he deems rational (meaning those that agree with his political opinions), he is a man who sneers at religious people. Nowadays, he mostly looks down upon Muslims, who are a popular target of scorn among the right-wingers he hangs out with. While he cloaks this bigotry as concern for Jihadism and encroaching Islamism, in reality, Sargon despises Christianity almost as much. He has said more than once that fundamentalist evangelical preachers are as dangerous as ISIS and that it lauds the destruction of the Anglican Church at the hands of those he might otherwise oppose politically, the social justice warriors. And the less is said about his opinions about Catholicism, the better. Sargon also has shown derogatory attitudes towards traditional African religions and Hinduism in some of his videos.
Sargon’s opinion of religion is not intellectual in nature, but emotional. He is disgusted by the mere mention of God, recoiling like a vampire. The most extreme example of this was in his live reaction to Donald Trump’s inauguration earlier this year. In that livestream, he reacted in an extremely negative way to mere prayer. Let me repeat: he was triggered by mere prayer. This is a common atheist trope, and Sargon exemplified it wholeheartedly.
Now to the main topic of this video: the fake Christians that he hangs out with. It’s no surprise that someone as nasty towards religion as him would have some equally vile friends, one of whom I had the displeasure of meeting. Sargon’s groupies are mainly mooching off their pals’ fame. None of them are particularly insightful or interesting, and they will parrot each others’ opinions like monkeys whenever. Some are a bit more left-wing, some are a bit more right-wing, but they are all equally slimy. The best example of this was Bantu Rhino. I had the “pleasure” of being in a livestream with Bantu one afternoon. Believing it to be the perfect opportunity, I gave a challenge to Sargon, but Bantu Rhino took up the offer. The offer was this: Bantu would argue the theist position and I the atheist position. I consulted my friend, Max Kolbe, on this, and Max was excited to take my place. Little did we know how vile Bantu could be.
The terms of the debate were simple: Bantu would either pick one of five of Edward Feser’s arguments from “Five Proofs of God” and argue for it, or use the research from Dr. Jeffrey Long’s research on Near Death Experiences to argue for the supernatural. We, in turn, would agree to not strawmanning the argument and not bringing up irrelevant points. However, Bantu said that he wanted to include his own arguments. He claims that he studied philosophy of religion, and had created his own argument for God based on the fact that the Universe had God’s divine properties. We refused: use the arguments we presented or don’t play ball. We did not want him gish-galloping or rambling about incoherent nonsense. Plus, to our summation, the argument was terrible. Bantu’s response? To threaten to knock out my teeth. The resulting back and forth ended with everyone just calling off the whole deal. Apparently, when atheists have their integrity or credentials challenged, they see fit to threaten people with violence.
The lesson from this experience is this: if you meet some atheist that you don’t know that claims to have some background in science or philosophy or religion or whatever, be skeptical of him. Atheists have no problem lying about their credentials to make themselves seem more credible because they have no honor.

Sargon of Akkad is always laughable when he tries to explore ideas. Being an Atheist, his choice of materials to read are also surprisingly predictable as he narrowminds his way along the typical Atheist path. It leads nowhere of course but perhaps the trip will be worth it to him. When he figures out none of the Founders could stand Thomas Paine and that it’s for good reason, he might want to move on.

(https://greatdebatecommunity.com/2017/11/29/bloggers-and-youtubers-deflating-atheism-and-escaping-atheism/)
McRae is fully aware that Atheists on the internet routinely harass, doxx, censor, deplatform, and otherwise bully people. He is fully aware that my children have received harassment and threats from his fellow Atheists. He is fully aware that the “Encyclopedia of American Loons” is not a credible publication, it’s just a blog put together by some of his fellow hate cult “Skeptics.”
Why use non-credible source and doxx people? Well, that would be because he’s a hatemonger and bully who can’t defend his ideology.
McRae also likes to pretend he’s a philosopher. He isn’t. He mostly just makes things up off the top of his head. But that’s another conversation.
Here’s our video response. Please, if you see Steve McRae, ask him to stop doxxing his critics, using non-credible hate sites as his source, and to leave my children alone.

Title: Richard Dawkins is a Proven Pseudoscientist and Cult Leader
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/11/21/richard-dawkins-proven-pseudoscientist-cult-leader/
Category: Science
Date: November 21, 2017
Entry: 
This man is a Zoologist, whose Selfish Gene, Memetic Theory, and God As Delusion hypotheses are all debunked pseudoscience.
Richard Dawkins has managed to go through his life bamboozling scientists into thinking he’s a great philosopher, and everybody else into thinking he’s a great scientist. In reality, he is neither.
As someone who was long fooled by Dawkins–back when I was an Atheist, I really thought he was at least a reputable scientist–I am sickened when I see a man who uses his science credentials to promote pseudoscience.
To my delight however, I was handed a prime opportunity to help publicly educate people on one of the most thoroughly noxious pseudo-scientists, pseudo-historians, and pseudo-philosophers on Planet Earth when I was presented by one of his followers with this hilarious paper:
Journal of Bioeconomics (2009): An empirical investigation of organizational memetic variation. 11:135–164. DOI 10.1007/s10818-009-9061-1
“Peer reviewed papers” are so respected by Scientism fanatics they obviously don’t bother to read them. I, on the other hand, make a point of reading such papers before I trust them–after all, it’s an open secret you can’t trust the peer review system anymore.
Anyway, I read it. The paper clearly illustrates the fallacy of Memetic Theory with 30 pages or so of handwaving and smoke-blowing that attempts–and admittedly fails–to provide some sort of empirical framework for Memetics. This is fascinating on multiple levels. Read it yourself if you don’t believe me.
But first, notice the publisher: Journal of Bioeconomics. That journal is an obscure publication that “Encourages creative dialogue between biologists and economists.” Change that to “biologists and feminist academics” and tell me how it would read to you.
Second, I happen to know that the only peer reviewed journal that ever tried to make the case for Memetics as a real science, known simply as “Journal of Memetics,” ceased publication in 2005 due to lack of interest or much in the way of results. These researchers had been working on trying to make something real of Memetics since 1976–that’s right, 1976. They eventually gave up, having produced almost nothing coherent to back up the incoherent Memetic Theory.
So now fancy this: four years after the only journal to ever really take Memetics Theory seriously threw in the towel, some obscure Memetics advocates manage to get a tentative paper published in 2009. A paper where they admit clearly that Memetics is “empirically under-developed” and finally, after 30 pages of meandering handwaving, conclude with this devastating line:
Ours is a tentative first empirical move in organizational research toward the micro/macro resolution we see in biology.
That’s right kids. More than 40 years after Richard Dawkins first proposed Memetic Theory, two researchers published a “tentative first empirical move.” They don’t even claim they showed anything empirical, just that they may be close to having something that might be empirical someday. There’s been no followup that I can find.
Memetic Theory is busted. So, by the way, is Selfish Gene Theory.
If you doubt Selfish Gene is busted, you should see the way Dawkins’ fellow Atheist and far more accomplished Evolutionary Biologist, Lynn Margulis, demolished him at Oxford University just a few years ago: Margulis-Dawkins Debate, 2012.
Margulis, an Atheist, an accomplished Evolutionary Biologist, and a member of both the American AND Russian Academy of Sciences (a rare honor and distinction) showed that most life on Earth doesn’t even use nuclear DNA and freely swaps what genetic material it has with other organisms–and the human body has more such organisms in it than it has cells. This leads to the obvious question of what cells and organisms really use DNA for, and what the limits of DNA might be. While admitting to “liking” Selfish Gene as a crude way to describe large animals, Margulis utterly demolished the NeoDarwinist paradigm that ‘Selfish Gene’ is based on for an audience of some of the world’s foremost Evolutionary Biologists and other scholars.
This was a long time coming. Many biologists, especially young ones, knew it would happen because Margulis and quite a few others had been showing for decades already that NeoDarwinism (the basis of Selfish Gene) was bunk.
Even now, while there are some old grayhairs holding out for it, almost no one who studies evolution or genetics believes there’s anything to Selfish Gene or NeoDarwinism. As scientists say of incoherent gibberish, Selfish Gene is so bad it’s not even wrong. Only the dying remnants of Dawkins’ Celebrity Scientist cult still really hold out for it.
And by the way, Memetic Theory was specifically Dawkins’ effort to mesh Ideas and mental processes to Selfish Gene theory. In other words, Selfish Gene is the debunked “science” that Memetic Theory is based on.
You can’t get more pseudo-sciencey than one debunked theory on top of another debunked theory. Except maybe with “Feminist Theory” or “Social Justice Theory”.
Finally, the notion of God as a delusion, which Dawkins is fond of asserting, has no empirical basis in psychological or psychiatric research, either. God As Delusion is unscientific poppycock. See “Does Evolutionary Psychology Explain Why We Believe In God? (Part 2).” 
What does all this mean? It means all the big things Richard Dawkins is known for–Selfish Gene, Memetic Theory, and the God Delusion–are all either pseudoscience, or not science at all. But it’s worse than that: They all run up against demonstrable science that proves them wrong.
Sorry Richard Dawkins Fans, but there’s no more substance to Dawkins and his work than  the average ‘Famous Astrologer’ found at “Top Ten Astrologers.”
In reality, Mr. Dawkins just doesn’t like God as an idea, even though countless perfectly sane, non-delusional people know God is, at minimum, a perfectly rational and coherent concept based on evidence. (See http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts-god Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy for a rational analysis of the idea.)
I continue to double, triple dare any member of the “Online Skeptic Community” or their followers to read The Last Superstition.  By the way, I hope any or all of them  one day have the guts to finally start talking to theists who are at least as smart as they are.
*Update*: A check on the principle author of the 2009 (Jill Shepherd · Bill McKelvey) paper that attempted–and failed–to find a scientific basis for Meme theory was an obscure researcher with mostly a business management background, with a secondary author whose background is also primarily business management.
That’s a real cutting-edge research team right there. And neither seems to have published anything since 2009 on this or other major topics besides business management. No surprise. There’s no “there” there when it comes to “Memetic Theory.”  Memetic Theory isn’t science and never has been.
*Update 2*: A former Dawkinsite, Sue Blackmore  of The Guardian attended the “Explaining religion” conference in September of 2010.  She spoke first, presenting the view from memetics that religions begin as by-products but then evolve and spread, like viruses, using humans to propagate themselves for their own benefit and to the detriment of the people they infect.  By the end, though, she acknowledged that, while religions can be ‘memeplexes’ to an outside observer, they are not viruses, “unless we twist the concept of a “virus” to include something helpful and adaptive to its host as well as something harmful, it simply does not apply.” The article is online at the following location; https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2010/sep/16/why-no-longer-believe-religion-virus-mind.
Joe Brewer, wrote a fawning adulation of Dawkins’ Memetic Theory (https://evolution-institute.org/blog/a-forty-year-update-on-meme-theory/), focusing on how societal knowledge and developments are “translated into slogans, political speeches, editorial commentaries, and dinner table debates more times than can be counted.”  He continues in this vein, stating that this body of tools and techniques can be applied to meme theory, demonstrating that “researchers across many fields have found value in the perspective that culture can be studied as information patterns that arise in a variety of social settings routinely and with modular elements that are readily discernible in each new instance. The claim that information patterns do not replicate is contradicted by the evidence for image-schematic structures (like the metaphor for taxes above with its distinctive inferential logic and recognizable use cases.”
Greg Downey of neuroanthropology.net wrote a scathing indictment of memetics at Neoruanthropology.net.  In the blog, he openly states “I think ‘memetics’ is one of the bigger crocks hatched in recent decades, hiding in the shadow of respectable evolutionary theory, suggesting that anyone who doesn’t immediately concede to the ‘awesome-ness’ of meme-ness is somehow afraid of evolutionary theory. Let me just make this perfectly clear: I teach about evolutionary theory. I like Charles Darwin. I have casts of hominid skulls in my office. I still think ‘memetics’ is nonsense on stilts on skates on thin ice on borrowed time (apologies to Bentham), as deserving of the designation ‘science’ as astrology, phrenology, or economic forecasting.”  ).
In his critique of memetics he begins with a declaration that “memetics sucks the air out of the room for a serious consideration of the ways that culture, knowledge, technology, and human evolution might be interrelated. That is, like a theory of humours and vapors in illness, it provides pseudo-explanations in place of just getting the hell out of the way of serious thought.” He continues by adding that he hates “the concept of ‘ideas replicating from brain to brain”.  He states that he works in physical education and imitative learning; shouldn’t he be happy that memetic theory places such a premium on imitative learning? He lists Ten Problems with Memetics to keep it manageable.  I have copied his problems and summarized the issues for the sake of brevity.
1) Reifying the activity of brains: ‘Culture’ is already a bit of a reification (treating a complex of heterogeneous behaviors or concepts as a ‘thing’).  Therefore, a ‘meme’ is a kind of super-reification of any human idea or concept.  When a memeticist claims that ‘ideas replicate from brain to brain,’ we consider the potential meanings of what they are saying.  To argue that ‘ideas’ are any form of self-serving agent that can replicate demands several layers of reification that are profoundly crippling to memetic theory.
2) Attributing personality to the reification of ideas: It’s one thing to reify a concept, it’s another thing to start attributing it a whole complex personality, drives, desires, and levels of different reification.  This line of theororizing rapidly tumbles down the trail of ‘ideas have us’ rather than the reverse.
3) Doesn’t ‘self-replicating’ mean replicating by one’s self?  There are problems with defining even a gene as a ‘self-replicating’ structure, like, if DNA is so self-replicating, why is it so chemically inert? (Hit to Selfish Gene theory) Self-replicating’ means, by definition, replicating by itself. Has anyone, ever, anywhere, seen an idea ‘replicate’ itSELF?
4) The term ‘meme’ applied to divergent phenomena. Calling an idea a ‘meme’ gets around the enormous problem of incommensurate phenomena in the same category. Memeticists refer to single ideas, strings of idea, melodies, and a host of other things as ‘memes.’ Even the most cursory glance reveals serious problems of scale; is a meme a single idea, a chain of ideas, a system of ideas, or an entire worldview?
5) Could memes transfer stably? Any tranfer of information is fraught with ‘transcription’ errors (try the game of telephone). Though the term ‘transcription’ risks dignifying the whole ‘meme=DNA’ metaphor which memeticists are abusing like a borrowed mule. Even teaching might demonstrate how utterly improbable it is that ANYTHING gets copied accurately
6) A host will not evolve traits in order for parasite to benefit: That is, unless a trait is beneficial in natural selection to the host, the parasite is not going to get evolution to create a better host for its own benefit. If the meme is truly a parasite, then there’s no way that the human brain is going to grow for the good of the meme.
7) Trivial examples as analogy to ideological change: A recurring problem in memetics theory is triviality being used to explain serious issues. These simplistic examples are then argued to be analogous to something like Christian conversion or the spread of capitalism, as if getting a jingle stuck in your head is like undergoing a major religio-ideological or political-economic social transformation.
8) Gradual cultural transmission not like infection: The metaphor of ‘infection’ is another one that gets used in memes, as it is clear that memes must have some sort of insidious dimenion.  They argue that ideas are infectious. Are they saying that annoying commercials or insipid songs really take over our brains and is force us to do their bidding? 

9) Objective ‘science’ inconsistent with normative judgments about memes: There’s this strong stream of judgment in most memeticists that’s inconsistent with evolutionary theory. Some argue that ‘toxic ideas’ are like the pathogens brought by explorers to the New World. They state that Western memes are wiping out indigenous ideas around the world in much the same way that European diseases obliterated native populations in the New World..
10) Resistance to memetics is not ‘anti-Darwinism; Darwinism not a religion: It’s not ‘Darwinism’ that Greg says he supports, like it’s a cult or a form of thought that he must follow religiously; adding that ‘Darwinism’ is only useful in that it is a theory that provides hypotheses to be tested, a powerful explanatory framework that explains some (though not all) phenomena
This was a long time coming. Many biologists, especially young ones, knew it would happen because Margulis and quite a few others had been showing for decades already that NeoDarwinism (the basis of Selfish Gene) was bunk.
Even now, while there are some old grayhairs holding out for it, almost no one who studies evolution or genetics believes there’s anything to Selfish Gene or NeoDarwinism. As scientists say of incoherent gibberish, Selfish Gene is so bad it’s not even wrong. Only the dying remnants of Dawkins’s Celebrity Scientist cult still really hold out for it.
And by the way, Memetic Theory was specifically Dawkins’s effort to mesh Ideas and mental processes to Selfish Gene theory. In other words, Selfish Gene is the debunked “science” that Memetic Theory is based on.
You can’t get more pseudosciencey than one debunked theory on top of another debunked theory. Except maybe with “Feminist Theory” or “Social Justice Theory.”
Finally, the notion of God as a delusion, which Dawkins is fond of asserting, has no empirical basis in psychological or psychiatric research, either. God As Delusion is unscientific poppycock. See my Proof from Evolutionary Psychology for references on that.
What does all this mean? It means all the big “scientific” things Richard Dawkins is known for–Selfish Gene, Memetic Theory, and the God Delusion–are all either pseudoscience, or not science at all. But it’s worse than that: They all run up against demonstrable science that proves them wrong.

When this author left off last week, I had just finished examined each of the approximately 12 people Dan Barker had listed as prominent atheists who had made great contributions to the world.  Of those twelve, no more than four met the actual criterion set by Dan Barker/Richard Dawkins for atheists.
As a partial counterpoint, atheists figure prominently in the annals of the greatest mass killings and atrocities of the twentieth century.  Communist Russia, Communist China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia and Cuba all are (or were) Communist Regimes that commit(ed) massive atrocities on their own citizens.  An atheist is not necessarily a Communist.  Communists must be atheistic because the state must supplant God as the supreme entity.

The web page http://www.adherents.com/adh_influ.html.  Lists the names, religions and achievements of the top 100 most influential people in world history and given by Michael H. Hart’s book ‘The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History.’  The top eight religious (non)affiliations are seen in the box to the right.  The atheists in that Top 100 list were: Karl Marx Simon Bolivar Joseph Stalin Sigmund Freud Vladimir Illych Lenin and Mao Zedong.  Considering the legacy of these people, it seems that there is something common in their ideology that leads to slaughter.
Dan states that “Most religions have consistently resisted progress–including the abolition of slavery; women’s right to vote and choose contraception and abortion; medical developments such as the use of anesthesia; scientific understanding of the heliocentric solar system and evolution, and the American principle of state/church separation.”
In the words of Ronald Reagan, “There you go again…”  Dan paints ALL RELIGIONS EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES with the same brush.  Is he judging the society of the Pharos, Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar by today’s standards?  Does he judge the regimes of Lenin, Mao, Stalin, Ho Chi Min, Kim Jung Il and Pol Pot by those same standards?
The practice of slavery is as old as time, likely dating back to the Stone Age (as the Stone Age civilizations found in the Americas did).  The practice of slavery was global as every society (at one time or another) practiced slavery
The ‘enlightened’ (and often atheistic) ‘elite progressives’ such as Margaret Sanger and Woodrow Wilson (resurrected the dying KKK) of the first half of the twentieth century, judged themselves as the torchbearers and arbiters of human progress.  They alone had the intellect and wisdom necessary to guide and make all the ‘tough calls’ for the ignorant masses they would rule over.  They were the source of the eugenics movement which was used in turn to support many of the Jim Crow and segregation laws as well as the ‘Cleansing’ of undesirables in/by the Third Reich. Today, the eugenics movement is almost universally condemned now as evil, unfounded and pseudoscience.  Do we hold the progressives to today’s standards?
The standards for morals, public or private behavior, just as everything else changes as time goes by.  Christ did not explicitly condemn slavery, but the Golden Rule “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” makes it rather clear what He wanted people to do.  Hebrew law ordered Jews to treat slaves as family and the Jew who killed a slave was to die, just as they would for killing a fellow Jew.  The Muslim Religion not only allows, but prescribes enslavement of non-believers.  Christianity and Judaism both demand humane treatment of others.  Christianity demands it regardless of race, class, sex, etc.  The abolitionist movements in Europe in America came from Christianity.  Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Baha’i faith, officially condemned slavery in 1874.  In Hinduism, the vedas of about 600+ BC taught that slavery was contrary to their goals.  Over time, the teachings of the leaders in the religion went back and forth.  Buddhism has a long history of generally condemning slavery, though debt slavery could still occur.  Finally, Buddhist Emperor Ashoka banned slavery and renounced war.  This list does not contain any pagan religions, Confucianism, Shinto or innumerable others that have existed throughout time.  Do these marked difference in beliefs not illustrate that lumping religions all together is like lumping all political parties, all Germans, Japanese (or any other nationality) or atheists into a single unit?  Five of the six most influential atheists were dictators of the most tyrannical, bloody regimes of history.  The sixth was their political inspiration.  Can we therefore judge all atheists to be just like them?
All humans from any time and any place are hypocrites to one extent or another.  A person can behave devoutly in church and public places and become a veritable demon in their home or in a neighborhood where they are not known.  Yes some rulers in the past have used religion to justify war, subjugation, enslavement and many other evils.  Many atheists have done the same or worse with no excuses or cover whatsoever beyond ‘The Dialectic Demands It’.  The atheist has no standard for behavior.  By rejecting all religions and their teachings, the only available guide will be expediency.  Most religions seek to elevate the self to a higher level of purity or holiness.  Any theist who takes their faith seriously finds themselves held to a supposedly unchanging standard of ‘Good.’  A theistic person (if they are entirely honest) is aware of how far they fall below the goal of their faith and must therefore strive to improve themselves to become closer to the Creator, and finally reach Enlightenment/Nirvana/Heaven/Paradise.
To judge all religious people by a single incident or period of a single sect is patently ridiculous.  For every Salem Witch Trial there are civilians who hide friends, neighbors and strangers in their home because their faith tells them to.  Pope Pious XII sheltered 3000-4000 Jews in the papal summer palace outside Rome.  Allied airmen and Jews were sheltered inside the Vatican or other church and private properties.  If the Germans had chosen to search those locations, the SS would have likely looted the entire Vatican complex within Rome, all properties or accounts owned by the Holy See and the private homes then kill or imprison everyone within.
Women’s suffrage is yet another case of judging the past by today’s standards.  The pursuit of equality with men in political and other arenas amounted to the overthrow of 1,400 or more years of both tradition and laws based on those same traditions.  To claim that religions opposed women’s suffrage is equivalent to saying politics opposed women’s suffrage.  Religion is an ideology.  People are born into or choose to join one religion or another.  Western culture (particularly American) has chosen to divide the political and religious portions of our lives.  It is their choice whether they follow the dogma and traditions of the faith.  No one can or will force them.  If a preacher gives a sermon about a political issue, they are not serving a deity.  They are substituting politics for faith.  That being said, how can Dan, sitting in the nosebleed section of the bleachers, be in a position to criticize those who are actually trying to finish the race?
Next, we shall address the charges that Dan brings about religion slowing medical research, scientific advancement, hindering acceptance of evolution or interfering with the separation of church and state.
To the charges of interfering with medicine and science:  This author shakes his head slowly and repeats the Ronald Reagan quote from earlier.  The Catholic Church was the cradle of modern western science.  James Hannam refutes these accusations in his article found at: http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages.  Dr. Hannam points out where in history the charge of suppressing science originated and who exactly created the charges.   Even Stefan Molyneux, an atheist Canadian YouTube vlogger and host on Freedomain Radio has created episodes acknowledged that the Catholic Curch built western civilization.
When it comes to evolution, Dan may have a solid case.  Yes, some religions reject the theory because they read the bible in a literalist manner.  Others reject the theory because it seems to be a tool to eliminate God.  Many religious people embraced it enthusiastically and still do.  This writer believes it may simply be that God used evolution as a mechanism of creation.  Whenever belief systems are seen to collide, it will create tension and disagreement whether the two are actually contradicting each other or not.
The separation of church and state was never under the control of religion.  The truth is that in the Western Hemisphere, the church was never in control of the state.  The church often served as advisor or attempted to rein in rulers with threats of excommunication.  The union of church and state was done through political leaders declaring a religion the ‘official’ religion of the nation, then imprisoning, executing or exiling all who refused to follow the new official religion.  The American Experiment with the separation of church and state was never hindered by religion or religious leaders because no one wanted to wind up on the receiving end of state power used to suppress them.
The atheist initiative to drive religion out of any and every public or government space is in direct conflict with the portion of the First Amendment that states: “Congress Shall Make No Law Regarding Religion or the Free Exercise Thereof.”  Dan seems to be simultaneously claiming suppression by religion while attempting suppression of religion.
Dan Barker claims that freethought is a philosophical, not a political, position, that embraces adherents of virtually all political persuasions, including capitalists, libertarians, socialists, communists, Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives.  There a great deal of literature to negate his claim that there is no philosophical connection between atheism and communism.  The atheism in Communist regimes has been and continues to be a form of militant atheism which led to various acts of repression, including the razing of thousands of religious buildings and the killing, imprisoning, and oppression of religious leaders and believers.
The persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union was the result of the violently atheist Soviet government. In the first five years after the October Revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were murdered, many on the orders of Leon Trotsky. When Joseph Stalin came to power in 1927, he ordered his secret police, under Genrikh Yagoda to intensify persecution of Christians. In the next few years, 50,000 clergy were murdered, many were tortured, including crucifixion. “Russia turned red with the blood of martyrs”, said Father Gleb Yakunin of the Russian Orthodox Church.  According to Orthodox Church sources, as many as fifty million Orthodox believers may have died in the twentieth century, mainly from persecution by Communists.
Dan claims that Adam Smith and Ayn Rand were freethinkers and staunch capitalists though he provides no proof to indicate that they had heard of, never mind joined, the ‘Freethinker’ movement.  Ayn Rand claimed to be an objectivist, though, not a freethinker.  If he is claiming those two simply because they are atheists, then he must also accept Timothy McVeigh, Jeffery Dahmer and every other atheistic criminal in modern history.  Though the early Christian Church did have a somewhat communistic organization (see Acts of the Apostles) the experiment was quite short-lived because communism is a system that kills the human spirit and is actually contrary to Jesus’ teaching.
Dan says that North American freethinkers agree in their support of state/church separation.  This is quite an extraordinary claim.  It is almost unheard of for an organization to have 100% agreement on anything.
To answer the following question:  Is atheism/humanism a religion?  Dan Barton states, “No. Atheism is not a belief. It is the “lack of belief” in god(s). Lack of faith requires no faith. Atheism is indeed based on a commitment to rationality, but that hardly qualifies it as a religion.  Freethinkers apply the term religion to belief systems which include a supernatural realm, deity, faith in “holy” writings and conformity to an absolute creed.”
Claiming the definition of atheism to be merely ‘lack of belief’ is obfuscation as the definition has traditionally been belief that no God or gods exist/active denial of God’s existence  To hang onto a new redefinition in one dictionary out of all the brands available, is begging the question.  Further, to state lack of faith requires no faith is patently false. To even make this statement requires faith.  There is no research or empirical data to support that allegation.  Dan Barker has to have faith in his logic or reasoning to even make that statement.
https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanism-today/non-religious-beliefs/ The Humanists UK website features the following definitions for Atheist, Freethinker and Humanist
Atheist” includes those who reject a belief in the existence of God or gods and those who simply choose to live without God or gods. Along with this often, but not always, go disbelief in the soul, an afterlife, and other beliefs arising from god-based religions.
“Freethinker” is an old-fashioned term, popular in the nineteenth century, used of those who reject authority in matters of belief, especially political and religious beliefs. It was a very popular term in the 19th century and is still used in different languages in some European countries by non-religious organisations to describe themselves.
“Humanist” is used today to mean those who seek to live good lives without religious or superstitious beliefs. A humanist may embrace all or most of the other approaches introduced here, and in addition humanists believe that moral values follow on from human nature and experience in some way. Humanists base their moral principles on reason (which leads them to reject the idea of any supernatural agency), on shared human values and respect for others. They believe that people should work together to improve the quality of life for all and make it more equitable. Humanism is a full philosophy, “life stance” or worldview, rather than being about one aspect of religion, knowledge, or politics
Secular humanism has no god, bible or savior. It is based on natural rational principles. It is flexible and relativistic–it is not a religion.
The claim that ‘Freethinkers/Humanists/Atheists are not religions because they do not rely on “ a supernatural realm, deity, faith in “holy” writings and conformity to an absolute creed”  is completely false.  As Dan Barker describes ‘free thought’ it does in fact have a god (atheistic reason), bible (the writings of Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, Denning, et al), saviors (the atheistic apostles who wrote their bibles) the natural, rational principles, that freethinkers claim to base their philosophy on deliberately and consistently ignores all logical/physical/rational/medical evidence for a creator, the soul and anything else related to religion.
The flexibility and relativism Dan Barker claims for the freethinkers exists only for those who adhere completely to the doctrines he prescribes.  In the first installment of this series, I examined the cognitive dissonance that is involved with that description of ‘freethinking’ and how it demands absolute adherence to a set doctrine.
Mr. Barker finished his essay with the question, “Why should I be happy to be a freethinker?
He answers his question by stating the following, “Freethought is reasonable. Freethought allows you to do your own thinking. A plurality of individuals thinking, free from restraints of orthodoxy, allows ideas to be tested, discarded or adopted.  Freethinkers see no pride in the blind maintenance of ancient superstitions or self-effacing prostration before divine tyrants known only through primitive “revelations.” Freethought is respectable. Freethought is truly free.”
I ask again, Mr. Barker, “How can you state that any of those statements be true when you have laid out absolute demands for private beliefs to adhere to.  Nothing can be said to have freedom when there are boundaries placed on inquiry or pre-set answers to those possible questions.  I refer again to the first essay I wrote on this topic.
Stating a false claim repeated times Mr. Barker, does not make you any more correct.  You claim again and again that religions are ancient superstitions that blind people and prevent ideas from being tried and tested when the very science and scientific methods you espouse were developed in Medieval Monasteries. You decry blind adherence to ancient superstitions when there are growing proofs for the existence of a Creator in every field of scientific inquiry.  I respectfully suggest, Mr Barker,that you take a long, hard look in the proverbial mirror and honestly analyze the question of who is adhering blindly to a bankrupt ideology.

Jordan Peterson was recently “corrected” by Ailson Tieman of the Honeybadger Brigade–but using fake history, fake science, and a phony Victim Narrative. We hope she can find her way out of this madness she’s created, and that other young men aren’t sucked in by this mad “Gynocentrism” Narrative.

Alison Tieman’s original video to Jordan Peterson. Note that it is filled with Fake History, Fake Science, a Threat Narrative against religious men, and while it talks about men building bridges, all Alison Tieman actually does is set herself up as a wall between younger men and older men with wisdom and knowledge. Men BUILD ON THE WISDOM OF OLDER MEN, Honeybadger Brigade. You cannot rewrite the world anew. Start talking TO older men, religious or not.

The real red pill is that atheism isn’t particularly rational or incoherent, Honeybadgers do not deal honestly in history or science or theology or anything else, and your best wisdom will be gained from listening to older men, not strange women who feed your victim complex for cash.

When this author left off last week, I had just finished examined each of the approximately 12 people Dan Barker had listed as prominent atheists who had made great contributions to the world.  Of those twelve, no more than four met the actual criterion set by Dan Barker/Richard Dawkins for atheists.
As a partial counterpoint, atheists figure prominently in the annals of the greatest mass killings and atrocities of the twentieth century.  Communist Russia, Communist China, North Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia and Cuba all are (or were) Communist Regimes that commit(ed) massive atrocities on their own citizens.  An atheist is not necessarily a Communist.  Communists must be atheistic because the state must supplant God as the supreme entity.

The web page http://www.adherents.com/adh_influ.html.  Lists the names, religions and achievements of the top 100 most influential people in world history and given by Michael H. Hart’s book ‘The 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Persons in History.’  The top eight religious (non)affiliations are seen in the box to the right.  The atheists in that Top 100 list were: Karl Marx Simon Bolivar Joseph Stalin Sigmund Freud Vladimir Illych Lenin and Mao Zedong.  Considering the legacy of these people, it seems that there is something common in their ideology that leads to slaughter.
Dan states that “Most religions have consistently resisted progress–including the abolition of slavery; women’s right to vote and choose contraception and abortion; medical developments such as the use of anesthesia; scientific understanding of the heliocentric solar system and evolution, and the American principle of state/church separation.”
In the words of Ronald Reagan, “There you go again…”  Dan paints ALL RELIGIONS EVERYWHERE AT ALL TIMES with the same brush.  Is he judging the society of the Pharos, Alexander the Great or Julius Caesar by today’s standards?  Does he judge the regimes of Lenin, Mao, Stalin, Ho Chi Min, Kim Jung Il and Pol Pot by those same standards?
The practice of slavery is as old as time, likely dating back to the Stone Age (as the Stone Age civilizations found in the Americas did).  The practice of slavery was global as every society (at one time or another) practiced slavery
The ‘enlightened’ (and often atheistic) ‘elite progressives’ such as Margaret Sanger and Woodrow Wilson (resurrected the dying KKK) of the first half of the twentieth century, judged themselves as the torchbearers and arbiters of human progress.  They alone had the intellect and wisdom necessary to guide and make all the ‘tough calls’ for the ignorant masses they would rule over.  They were the source of the eugenics movement which was used in turn to support many of the Jim Crow and segregation laws as well as the ‘Cleansing’ of undesirables in/by the Third Reich. Today, the eugenics movement is almost universally condemned now as evil, unfounded and pseudoscience.  Do we hold the progressives to today’s standards?
The standards for morals, public or private behavior, just as everything else changes as time goes by.  Christ did not explicitly condemn slavery, but the Golden Rule “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you,” makes it rather clear what He wanted people to do.  Hebrew law ordered Jews to treat slaves as family and the Jew who killed a slave was to die, just as they would for killing a fellow Jew.  The Muslim Religion not only allows, but prescribes enslavement of non-believers.  Christianity and Judaism both demand humane treatment of others.  Christianity demands it regardless of race, class, sex, etc.  The abolitionist movements in Europe in America came from Christianity.  Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Baha’i faith, officially condemned slavery in 1874.  In Hinduism, the vedas of about 600+ BC taught that slavery was contrary to their goals.  Over time, the teachings of the leaders in the religion went back and forth.  Buddhism has a long history of generally condemning slavery, though debt slavery could still occur.  Finally, Buddhist Emperor Ashoka banned slavery and renounced war.  This list does not contain any pagan religions, Confucianism, Shinto or innumerable others that have existed throughout time.  Do these marked difference in beliefs not illustrate that lumping religions all together is like lumping all political parties, all Germans, Japanese (or any other nationality) or atheists into a single unit?  Five of the six most influential atheists were dictators of the most tyrannical, bloody regimes of history.  The sixth was their political inspiration.  Can we therefore judge all atheists to be just like them?
All humans from any time and any place are hypocrites to one extent or another.  A person can behave devoutly in church and public places and become a veritable demon in their home or in a neighborhood where they are not known.  Yes some rulers in the past have used religion to justify war, subjugation, enslavement and many other evils.  Many atheists have done the same or worse with no excuses or cover whatsoever beyond ‘The Dialectic Demands It’.  The atheist has no standard for behavior.  By rejecting all religions and their teachings, the only available guide will be expediency.  Most religions seek to elevate the self to a higher level of purity or holiness.  Any theist who takes their faith seriously finds themselves held to a supposedly unchanging standard of ‘Good.’  A theistic person (if they are entirely honest) is aware of how far they fall below the goal of their faith and must therefore strive to improve themselves to become closer to the Creator, and finally reach Enlightenment/Nirvana/Heaven/Paradise.
To judge all religious people by a single incident or period of a single sect is patently ridiculous.  For every Salem Witch Trial there are civilians who hide friends, neighbors and strangers in their home because their faith tells them to.  Pope Pious XII sheltered 3000-4000 Jews in the papal summer palace outside Rome.  Allied airmen and Jews were sheltered inside the Vatican or other church and private properties.  If the Germans had chosen to search those locations, the SS would have likely looted the entire Vatican complex within Rome, all properties or accounts owned by the Holy See and the private homes then kill or imprison everyone within.
Women’s suffrage is yet another case of judging the past by today’s standards.  The pursuit of equality with men in political and other arenas amounted to the overthrow of 1,400 or more years of both tradition and laws based on those same traditions.  To claim that religions opposed women’s suffrage is equivalent to saying politics opposed women’s suffrage.  Religion is an ideology.  People are born into or choose to join one religion or another.  Western culture (particularly American) has chosen to divide the political and religious portions of our lives.  It is their choice whether they follow the dogma and traditions of the faith.  No one can or will force them.  If a preacher gives a sermon about a political issue, they are not serving a deity.  They are substituting politics for faith.  That being said, how can Dan, sitting in the nosebleed section of the bleachers, be in a position to criticize those who are actually trying to finish the race?
Next, we shall address the charges that Dan brings about religion slowing medical research, scientific advancement, hindering acceptance of evolution or interfering with the separation of church and state.
To the charges of interfering with medicine and science:  This author shakes his head slowly and repeats the Ronald Reagan quote from earlier.  The Catholic Church was the cradle of modern western science.  James Hannam refutes these accusations in his article found at: http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages.  Dr. Hannam points out where in history the charge of suppressing science originated and who exactly created the charges.   Even Stefan Molyneux, an atheist Canadian YouTube vlogger and host on Freedomain Radio has created episodes acknowledged that the Catholic Curch built western civilization.
When it comes to evolution, Dan may have a solid case.  Yes, some religions reject the theory because they read the bible in a literalist manner.  Others reject the theory because it seems to be a tool to eliminate God.  Many religious people embraced it enthusiastically and still do.  This writer believes it may simply be that God used evolution as a mechanism of creation.  Whenever belief systems are seen to collide, it will create tension and disagreement whether the two are actually contradicting each other or not.
The separation of church and state was never under the control of religion.  The truth is that in the Western Hemisphere, the church was never in control of the state.  The church often served as advisor or attempted to rein in rulers with threats of excommunication.  The union of church and state was done through political leaders declaring a religion the ‘official’ religion of the nation, then imprisoning, executing or exiling all who refused to follow the new official religion.  The American Experiment with the separation of church and state was never hindered by religion or religious leaders because no one wanted to wind up on the receiving end of state power used to suppress them.
The atheist initiative to drive religion out of any and every public or government space is in direct conflict with the portion of the First Amendment that states: “Congress Shall Make No Law Regarding Religion or the Free Exercise Thereof.”  Dan seems to be simultaneously claiming suppression by religion while attempting suppression of religion.
Dan Barker claims that freethought is a philosophical, not a political, position, that embraces adherents of virtually all political persuasions, including capitalists, libertarians, socialists, communists, Republicans, Democrats, liberals and conservatives.  There a great deal of literature to negate his claim that there is no philosophical connection between atheism and communism.  The atheism in Communist regimes has been and continues to be a form of militant atheism which led to various acts of repression, including the razing of thousands of religious buildings and the killing, imprisoning, and oppression of religious leaders and believers.
The persecution of Christians in the Soviet Union was the result of the violently atheist Soviet government. In the first five years after the October Revolution, 28 bishops and 1,200 priests were murdered, many on the orders of Leon Trotsky. When Joseph Stalin came to power in 1927, he ordered his secret police, under Genrikh Yagoda to intensify persecution of Christians. In the next few years, 50,000 clergy were murdered, many were tortured, including crucifixion. “Russia turned red with the blood of martyrs”, said Father Gleb Yakunin of the Russian Orthodox Church.  According to Orthodox Church sources, as many as fifty million Orthodox believers may have died in the twentieth century, mainly from persecution by Communists.
Dan claims that Adam Smith and Ayn Rand were freethinkers and staunch capitalists though he provides no proof to indicate that they had heard of, never mind joined, the ‘Freethinker’ movement.  Ayn Rand claimed to be an objectivist, though, not a freethinker.  If he is claiming those two simply because they are atheists, then he must also accept Timothy McVeigh, Jeffery Dahmer and every other atheistic criminal in modern history.  Though the early Christian Church did have a somewhat communistic organization (see Acts of the Apostles) the experiment was quite short-lived because communism is a system that kills the human spirit and is actually contrary to Jesus’ teaching.
Dan says that North American freethinkers agree in their support of state/church separation.  This is quite an extraordinary claim.  It is almost unheard of for an organization to have 100% agreement on anything.
To answer the following question:  Is atheism/humanism a religion?  Dan Barton states, “No. Atheism is not a belief. It is the “lack of belief” in god(s). Lack of faith requires no faith. Atheism is indeed based on a commitment to rationality, but that hardly qualifies it as a religion.  Freethinkers apply the term religion to belief systems which include a supernatural realm, deity, faith in “holy” writings and conformity to an absolute creed.”
Claiming the definition of atheism to be merely ‘lack of belief’ is obfuscation as the definition has traditionally been belief that no God or gods exist/active denial of God’s existence  To hang onto a new redefinition in one dictionary out of all the brands available, is begging the question.  Further, to state lack of faith requires no faith is patently false. To even make this statement requires faith.  There is no research or empirical data to support that allegation.  Dan Barker has to have faith in his logic or reasoning to even make that statement.
https://humanism.org.uk/humanism/humanism-today/non-religious-beliefs/ The Humanists UK website features the following definitions for Atheist, Freethinker and Humanist
Atheist” includes those who reject a belief in the existence of God or gods and those who simply choose to live without God or gods. Along with this often, but not always, go disbelief in the soul, an afterlife, and other beliefs arising from god-based religions.
“Freethinker” is an old-fashioned term, popular in the nineteenth century, used of those who reject authority in matters of belief, especially political and religious beliefs. It was a very popular term in the 19th century and is still used in different languages in some European countries by non-religious organisations to describe themselves.
“Humanist” is used today to mean those who seek to live good lives without religious or superstitious beliefs. A humanist may embrace all or most of the other approaches introduced here, and in addition humanists believe that moral values follow on from human nature and experience in some way. Humanists base their moral principles on reason (which leads them to reject the idea of any supernatural agency), on shared human values and respect for others. They believe that people should work together to improve the quality of life for all and make it more equitable. Humanism is a full philosophy, “life stance” or worldview, rather than being about one aspect of religion, knowledge, or politics
Secular humanism has no god, bible or savior. It is based on natural rational principles. It is flexible and relativistic–it is not a religion.
The claim that ‘Freethinkers/Humanists/Atheists are not religions because they do not rely on “ a supernatural realm, deity, faith in “holy” writings and conformity to an absolute creed”  is completely false.  As Dan Barker describes ‘free thought’ it does in fact have a god (atheistic reason), bible (the writings of Harris, Dawkins, Hitchens, Denning, et al), saviors (the atheistic apostles who wrote their bibles) the natural, rational principles, that freethinkers claim to base their philosophy on deliberately and consistently ignores all logical/physical/rational/medical evidence for a creator, the soul and anything else related to religion.
The flexibility and relativism Dan Barker claims for the freethinkers exists only for those who adhere completely to the doctrines he prescribes.  In the first installment of this series, I examined the cognitive dissonance that is involved with that description of ‘freethinking’ and how it demands absolute adherence to a set doctrine.
Mr. Barker finished his essay with the question, “Why should I be happy to be a freethinker?
He answers his question by stating the following, “Freethought is reasonable. Freethought allows you to do your own thinking. A plurality of individuals thinking, free from restraints of orthodoxy, allows ideas to be tested, discarded or adopted.  Freethinkers see no pride in the blind maintenance of ancient superstitions or self-effacing prostration before divine tyrants known only through primitive “revelations.” Freethought is respectable. Freethought is truly free.”
I ask again, Mr. Barker, “How can you state that any of those statements be true when you have laid out absolute demands for private beliefs to adhere to.  Nothing can be said to have freedom when there are boundaries placed on inquiry or pre-set answers to those possible questions.  I refer again to the first essay I wrote on this topic.
Stating a false claim repeated times Mr. Barker, does not make you any more correct.  You claim again and again that religions are ancient superstitions that blind people and prevent ideas from being tried and tested when the very science and scientific methods you espouse were developed in Medieval Monasteries. You decry blind adherence to ancient superstitions when there are growing proofs for the existence of a Creator in every field of scientific inquiry.  I respectfully suggest, Mr Barker,that you take a long, hard look in the proverbial mirror and honestly analyze the question of who is adhering blindly to a bankrupt ideology.

Title: The Cost of Marriage

Every relationship ends in one of two ways; either you break up or you get married.Unfortunately, the sharp wisdom of that understanding is lost on so many of us as we struggle to force compatibility where it doesn’t exist and suffer in prolonged relationships that should have ended long ago. Why do we do this?
Divorce is something that has been shown to have severely negative effects on everyone involved. As a society, it is costing us dearly.
Divorce has statistically blown up over the past century, seemingly out of nowhere. Considering its negative effects on society, we should be trying to figure out how to get marriages and relationships back into a healthy equilibrium. Some might argue that the reason divorce is so prevalent today is because women are not bound to unhappy marriages due to greater freedom and economic opportunity.
Prior to this, they would argue, women had to remain stuck in unhealthy and abusive relationships because they couldn’t survive on their own. There might be some truth to that, but the position seems exaggerated. Are we to believe that 50% or more of marriages from previous generations were abusive and miserable and that if they could divorce they would? I’ll admit, that we probably could have expected an increase in divorce with the liberation of women, but not nearly to the degree that we’ve seen.
My sense of it is that it has a lot to do with sex. The sexual revolution taught us that we could discard the shackles of commitment and enjoy sex within casual relationships and encounters without the burden of consequence. Since this was a new and untested belief, the claim that a culture that embraced sex before marriage could do so without consequence was a complete guess. I would call it wishful thinking.
The thing about sex is that it’s extremely powerful. It’s something that, when you let it out, it’s very difficult to control. One of the undisputed side effects of sex is that it creates intense psychological and emotional attachment, especially for women. Since we’ve convinced ourselves that we can have sex without any measure of commitment, this puts us at odds with our biology and our psychology. You might go on a date and decide that you don’t really like the person you’re with and could never see yourself having a long term relationship with them, but then you hook up anyways for different reasons. Suddenly you find yourself psychologically attached to someone you never would have chosen to be so with. This makes it hard to move on and I believe that it creates long term, dysfunctional relationships that never should have existed.
When my wife and I were planning our wedding, one of the prerequisites our Church had for us was that we do a marriage preparation course. It was a weekend retreat that involved listening to talks, having group discussions, and doing worksheets together. The worksheets took each couple through a series of questions to get them talking about things that were essential to the anticipation of a life long commitment. As my fiancé and I went over the questions together we found ourselves rolling our eyes more than we were gaining insight. We felt like the talking points were so basic and obvious.
But as we came together in larger group discussions with other couples, we learned that several of them were confronting these questions for the very first time and were discovering some pretty serious disagreements between them. One couple even admitted that they might be calling the engagement off. I was at a complete loss to understand how they could get so far into an engagement and marriage planning process without ever having these kinds of conversations.
I think the reason, in many cases, is because these couples put sex ahead of a committed relationship and this routine of sexual intimacy had built an extremely powerful attachment that convinced them they were desperately in love even though they were completely incompatible with each other. For too many couples, I think it ends up being too late and they get married only to discover their incompatibility after they’ve blended their lives in ill-fated marriages.
If couples waited to have sex, they would never fall for someone that they shouldn’t. They would see the incompatibility for what it is and move on. Sex is an expression of intimacy and intimacy is something that should only be shared with someone that has earned that level of awareness of you. I argue that putting commitment ahead of premature intimacy is how we fix families and reduce the catastrophic epidemic of divorce which is costing our society severely.

Alison Tieman, who effectively stole the Honeybadger Brigade from the work of others, and who now basks in the glory of something called “Red Pill Movie” that she would not even have been in had it not been for the work of others she stepped over, regularly peddles poisonous ideological pseudohistory aimed at one thing: demeaning religion and religious men, with pseudoscience and pseudohistory and a cult mentality wherein her bizarre “Gynocentrism” ideology is taught to vulnterable, at-risk men–while she feeds them a diet of porn and hedonism and hatred and contempt for older men.
Alison Tieman is in no way a Men’s Human Rights Activist, or even an activist for Men’s Rights generally. She is only an advocate for men who accept her bizarre twisted cult ideology, and who toe the line in what is undeniably a Cult of Personality she’s created around herself and her own squirelly theories about the world–using a Honeybadger Brigade name she did not create, did not earn, and stole from others.

Title: Response to ‘Freethinker’ Propaganda Part 4
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/11/02/response-freethinker-propaganda-part-4/
Category: Uncategorized
Date: November 2, 2017
Entry: 
Dan Barker states that “Freethinkers recognize that there is much chaos, ugliness and pain in the universe for which any explanation of origins must also account.”  Why does Dan believe that the perceived negatives he lists would not exist if God had created the universe? Does he expect God to provide us with flowers and perpetual orderliness whilst we enjoy our perfect physiques and march together in grinning lockstep? Does he believe that our Creator to give day with no night or otherwise self-contradict?  Does Dan Barker expect God to make a single-sided coin or a round square? The creator of the universe, and the laws that govern all matter and energy, will not create a system that ignores those laws, even to give us a world free of death, pain and other ‘negative’ things. In this universe all physical things begin and also end.  God WILL NOT go against his nature by violating logic or His own Nature.
Dan then goes on to add; “Freethinkers are convinced that religious claims have not withstood the tests of reason. Not only is there nothing to be gained by believing an untruth, but there is everything to lose when we sacrifice the indispensable tool of reason on the altar of superstition. Most freethinkers consider religion to be not only untrue, but harmful. It has been used to justify war, slavery, sexism, racism, homophobia, mutilations, intolerance, and oppression of minorities. The totalitarianism of religious absolutes chokes progress.”
Dan apparently does not miss a single trope in the atheist playbook. He brings out the old stereotype that science and religion are at odds with each other. This conflict exists only in the minds of those who want to tar theists as ‘anti-science’ or ‘oppressive’.  In the June 14, 2009 issue of The Guardian (hardly a bastion of religiosity) James Hannam’s story entitled, ‘Science and Religion: A History of Conflict?’ makes the case that “…some atheists, like Jerry Coyne, have been insisting that there is really a battle between religion and science.” Coyne resists any accommodation between religious and non-religious scientists to defend Darwinism from attacks by fundamentalist Creationist advocates. Hannam suggests that, He (Coyn) doesn’t want to see the scientists joining forces against the creationist common enemy in case that legitimises religion.  Whether such an alliance would ‘legitimize’ religion in the eyes of modern science is debatable. What is not quite so debatable is that there is a ‘stigma’ about how western religions and science have interacted.
For some of this stigma (that has now covered them as well) the Protestant churches have only themselves to blame. The article ‘HISTORY AND MYTH: THE INQUISITION’ by Robert P. Lockwood (8/2000) examines how early Protestanism created “…an invented history meant to portray Catholicism as the enemy of free thought…a perverse form of medieval superstition that survives on the ignorance of believers and the Church’s own violent will to power.” These myths served a purpose in the war of propaganda between Catholicism and the dissenting churches of the 16th Century Reformation and were perpetuated through the 18th century Enlightenment and the 19th century world of progress and scientism.
Now, however, all Christians find themselves targeted by some variation of the early Protestant propaganda. The old accusations, slightly changed to apply to all theists (usually Christians), are now employed by assorted atheist groups and individuals. These stories are now such a part of Western Society that they constitute basic historical assumptions used (without the necessity of analyzing or addressing those positions) as useful rhetorical tools, particularly in the public arena, because they are universally understood and accepted.
One of the old anti-Catholic attacks (now come back to attack all theists) is the accusation that the Catholic Church forbade science and scientific research. Hannam notes that even though the popular perception of a historical conflict remains strong, it hasn’t stopped all serious historians from queuing up to condemn it. John Hedley Brooke and Peter Harrison at Oxford; David Lindberg and Ron Numbers at Wisconsin-Madison; and Simon Shapin in California have all tried to put the record straight. But as Numbers ruefully admits, “Despite a developing consensus among scholars that science and Christianity have not been at war, the notion of conflict has refused to die.”
In point of fact, the greater portion of ‘evidence’ for conflict myth is bogus. It is believed only because most people are ignorant of real history. The populace are taught or told the ‘religion vs science’ myths (either through ignorance or malice) and absorb the ‘information’ creating, a dissonance in which what they think they know about this topic is actually untrue. Hannam has edited a new collection of essays, published by Harvard University Press, called ‘Galileo Goes to Jail and Other Myths about Science and Religion’ in which he chips away some more from the edifice of popular opinion.
Dan Barker rhetorically asks. “Hasn’t religion done tremendous good in the world?” to set up his response of “Many religionists are good people–but they would be good anyway.”
How, in the name of his overweaning egotism, can he have even the slightest confidence in that assertion? How can he claim to know that Augustine, Aquinas, Francis of Assisi, Sarah Barton, Abraham Lincoln, George Washington or any of countless others would have been ‘good’ or ‘nice’ without a society built upon the ethics taught by Christianity?
“Religion does not have a monopoly on good deeds” he proclaims, adding that “Most modern social and moral progress has been made by people free from religion–including Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Charles Darwin, Margaret Sanger, Albert Einstein, Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, Marie Curie, H. L. Mencken, Sigmund Freud, Bertrand Russell, Luther Burbank and many others who have enriched humanity.”
In response to these claims, this writer must inquire, When did any theist publicly advance a claim that no atheists can be moral? Show me that person, living or dead, and I shall advocate against them.
Your entire screed up to this point, Mr. Barton, has essentially stated that ‘Freethinkers’ are in all ways superior to theists. The belief that atheists have higher IQs than theists is like the religion vs. science trope. A lot of noise and braggadocio, essentially zero facts. Now you seem to play the victim card and say that theists claim a monopoly on morality?  Usually, theists are quite aware of their sinful nature and work to become a person pleasing for their deity.
As for your Atheistist Luminaries list, let us examine them.
• Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Abolitionist Suffragette and Temperance Activist. Was traumatized as a young woman by a revivalist preacher. His sermons, combined with her Calvinist Presbyterianism, caused her to believe in her own damnation. Calvin and his followers believed in ‘Predestination’ (that your soul at birth is destined for either Heaven or Hell and nothing you can do in your life will change that destination). She did not return to organized Christianity, but that does not mean she was an atheist.
• Susan B. Anthony, Abolitionist, Suffragette and Temperance Activist. Was raised a ‘liberal Quaker’ less bound by the strict guidelines William Penn established. Later joined the Unitarians and tried to establish a doctrineless ‘Free Church’. Was horrified by the poverty and need she saw in Ireland in the 1880s and blamed God. Died an Agnostic because she could not reconcile the images of Loving God and Pain and misery on earth.
• Charles Darwin. Proposed the Theory of Evolution through Natural Selection. Charles was raised in the Anglican Church and later attended a Unitarian. The web address I place below gives ample evidence of Darwin’s religiosity as a young man and middle age. In Darwin’s own words, I shall address this question by inserting a passage from the site. “In what is perhaps his most revealing response, a letter in 1879 to John Fordyce, an author of works on scepticism, Darwin writes: [My] judgment often fluctuates…. Whether a man deserves to be called a theist depends on the definition of the term … In my most extreme fluctuations I have never been an atheist in the sense of denying the existence of a God. — I think that generally (and more and more so as I grow older), but not always, — that an agnostic would be the most correct description of my state of mind.” https://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/commentary/religion/what-did-darwin-believe
• Margaret Sanger: Birth Control and Abortion Advocate. Here is one that can honestly be called an atheist. It is relatively apparent that her atheism, radical politics and earnest desire to help women avoid unwanted pregnancies stem largely from her childhood. Her mother died from tuberculosis, possibly because her body had been weakened by 18 pregnancies which produced 11 children. Her father was atheistic and a radical activist who exerted tremendous force in Margaret’s formational years.
While it is indisputable that Margaret Sanger exercised tremendous impact on modern society, there is the question of whether those effects were positive or negative. Her advocating for the principles of eugenics, including sterilization of the ‘unfit’ brings her character and beliefs into question. Her firm support of birth control and abortion had the desired effects insofar as Planned Parenthood becoming a tremendous business. However, the availability of abortion and birth control has produced possibly unforeseen and undesired long term consequences on society at large.
• Albert Einstein: Highly Gifted Mathematical Theoretician. To answer this charge this writer turned to one who appeared the most researched and a source even ‘Freethinkers’ might listen to (https://www.bethinking.org/god/did-einstein-believe-in-god). I have paraphrased or lifted sections of John Marsh’s article addressing the question; Did Einstein Believe in God?
According to Richard Dawkins in ‘The God Delusion’, the definition of atheism is the belief that there is “nothing beyond the natural, physical world, no supernatural creative intelligence lurking behind the observable universe.” In that book, Dawkins presents Einstein as a prime example, and describes Einstein’s religion as pantheism, which he calls “sexed-up atheism.” According to Dawkins, “The one thing his theistic critics got right, was that Einstein was not one of them. He was repeatedly indignant at the suggestion he was a theist.” John Marsh begins his rebuttal of Dawkins with, “because Dawkins tells us that in his opinion “to deliberately confuse the two understandings of God is an act of intellectual high treason.”
In the Oxford English Dictionary we find the following definitions: theism is the belief in a deity, or deities, as opposed to atheism; and the belief in one God, as opposed to polytheism or pantheism. It is important to note that, firstly, the definition of theism does not necessarily include the notion that God is personal. Secondly, atheism is defined as a disbelief in, or denial of, the existence of a God. Thirdly, pantheism is a belief or philosophical theory that God is not only immanent (indwelling and sustaining the universe) but also identical with the universe.
Dawkins explains that in dealing with Einstein’s religious views he relied on Max Jammer’s book Einstein and Religion. Dawkins wrote: “The extracts that follow are taken from Max Jammer’s book (which is also my main source of quotations from Einstein himself on religious matters). However a very different picture emerges when we study what Einstein actually said, again as recorded in Jammer’s book. It seems Dawkins needs to be reminded of the ‘Ten New Commandments’ he lists in his own book. The seventh reads. “Test all things; always check your ideas against the facts, and be ready to discard even a cherished belief if it does not conform to them.” The following quotations from Einstein are all in Jammer’s book:
• “Behind all the discernible concatenations, there remains something subtle, intangible and inexplicable. Veneration for this force is my religion. To that extent, I am in point of fact, religious.”
• “Every scientist becomes convinced that the laws of nature manifest the existence of a spirit vastly superior to that of men.”
• “Everyone who is seriously involved in the pursuit of science becomes convinced that a spirit is manifest in the laws of the universe – a spirit vastly superior to that of man.”
• “The divine reveals itself in the physical world.”
• “My God created laws… His universe is not ruled by wishful thinking but by immutable laws.”
• “I want to know how God created this world. I want to know his thoughts.”
• “What I am really interested in knowing is whether God could have created the world in a different way.”
• “This firm belief in a superior mind that reveals itself in the world of experience, represents my conception of God.”
• “My religiosity consists of a humble admiration of the infinitely superior spirit; That superior reasoning power forms my idea of God.”
I am reasonably confident that Jammer, a friend and colleague of Einstein has a much greater credibility regarding Einstein’s beliefs than Dawkins. According to Jammer, “Einstein always protested against being regarded as an atheist.” This writer joins Mr. Marsh when he asks “What evidence does Dawkins have that Einstein was indignant at being called a theist?” Dawkins needs to explain this very peculiar discrepancy. Lastly Dawkins argues that science and religion are incompatible. Again Einstein takes the opposite point of view: “A legitimate conflict between science and religion cannot exist. Science without religion is lame; religion without science is blind.”
• Andrew Carnegie. Industrialist and Philanthropist. Andrew Carnegie witnessed intense sectarianism and strife in 19th century Scotland regarding religion and philosophy. Stemming from the reasonable desire to avoid violence in his life, young Carnegie kept his distance from organized religion and theism. Carnegie instead preferred to see things through naturalistic and scientific terms stating, “Not only had I got rid of the theology and the supernatural, but I had found the truth of evolution.” At this point one might be able to argue at least for ‘Lapsed Christian’, though there are no known documents from his life avowing to atheism.
Later in life, Carnegie’s firm opposition to religion softened. For many years he was a member o of Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, pastored from 1905 to 1926 by Social Gospel exponent Henry Sloane Coffin, while his wife and daughter belonged to the Brick Presbyterian Church. He also prepared (but did not deliver) an address in which he professed a belief in “an Infinite and Eternal Energy from which all things proceed”. Records exist of a short period of correspondence around 1912–1913 between Carnegie and `Abdu’l-Bahá, the eldest son of Bahá’u’lláh, founder of the Bahá’í Faith. In these letters, one of which was published in the New York Times in full text, Carnegie is extolled as a “lover of the world of humanity and one of the founders of Universal Peace”.
• Thomas Edison. Inventor, Entrepreneur. Historian Paul Israel has characterized Edison as a “freethinker”, just not in the way Dan Barker defines the term.  Edison was heavily influenced by Thomas Paine’s The Age of Reason. Edison defended Paine’s “scientific deism” by saying, “He has been called an atheist, but atheist he was not. Paine believed in a supreme intelligence, as representing the idea which other men often express by the name of deity.” In an October 2, 1910, interview in the New York Times Magazine, Edison stated: “Nature is what we know. We do not know the gods of religions. And nature is not kind, or merciful, or loving. If God made me the fabled God of the three qualities of which I spoke: mercy, kindness, love. He also made the fish I catch and eat. And where do His mercy, kindness, and love for that fish come in? No; nature made us-nature did it all-not the gods of the religions.”
Edison was accused of being an atheist for those remarks, and although he did not allow himself to be drawn into the controversy publicly, he clarified himself in a private letter, saying, “You have misunderstood the whole article, because you jumped to the conclusion that it denies the existence of God. There is no such denial, what you call God I call Nature, the Supreme intelligence that rules matter. All the article states is that it is doubtful in my opinion if our intelligence or soul or whatever one may call it lives hereafter as an entity or disperses back again from whence it came, scattered amongst the cells of which we are made.”
He also stated, “I do not believe in the God of the theologians; but that there is a Supreme Intelligence I do not doubt.”
Therefore, Edison is NOT a Freethinker by Dan’s own standards because he believed absolutely in a Supreme Being; an immaterial and unmeasurable Supreme Intelligence.
• Marie Curie. Researcher, Scientist. Maria’s mother Bronisława died of tuberculosis on May 1878, when Maria was ten years old. Less than three years earlier, Maria’s oldest sibling, Zofia, had died of typhus contracted from a boarder. Maria’s father was an atheist, her mother a devout Catholic. The deaths of Maria’s mother and sister caused her to give up Catholicism and become agnostic. To be an agnostic is to not believe in God’s existence or believe in the absence of God. As Dan has stated earlier, to be a ‘Freethinker’ is to believe in the absence of God.
• H. L. Mencken. Journalist, Editor. Humorist and Critic. It is difficult to know whether this man was an agnostic, mystic of some type or truly an atheist. The articles or websites I found were primarily devoted to his quotes. His words were cutting, acerbic and usually funny (if his ire was not directed at you). Few argue that his skill with the American language was unmatched in his day.
One of his most marked characteristics was that he attacked everyone and everything in he deemed undesirable in the American Culture. What I read of his quotes indicates that Menken had no love, or even respect, for organized religion of any type and that he had only the most superficial knowledge of Christianity typical of his generation. He condemned religion for coming between ‘a man and his god,’ whilst praising mysticism as a direct link. He once remarked, that if he found out that he had been wrong in his agnosticism, he would walk up to god in a manly way and say, “Sir, I made an honest mistake.”
• Sigmund Freud. Psychoanalysis Pioneer. Freud was very open and honest about his atheism and considered religion a ‘mental disorder similar to an Oedipal Complex. In ‘Moses and Monotheism’ (1939) he stated, “Religion is an attempt to get control over the sensory world, in which we are placed, by means of the wish-world, which we have developed inside us as a result of biological and psychological necessities.”
This is the second self-declared atheist and therefore the second ‘Freethinker’ Dan Barker placed on his list.
• Bertrand Russell. Philosopher and Mathematician.  Bertrand Russel thought that religious questions did not really belong to the discipline of philosophy. This view of philosophy predisposed him to scepticism about subjects that involve ambiguity, interpretation, and perhaps a personal, experiential kind of insight. Ethics is one such subject and religion even more so. Like earlier rationalist thinkers such as Descartes and Spinoza, Russell had an exacting standard for what qualified as “knowledge”, and argued that if philosophy is the search for truth then it should concern itself only with the kind of certainty associated with basic mathematical functions.
Nietzsche once argued that although science makes claims to knowledge, these claims are as deluded as those of religious dogmatists. Russell accepted that what we customarily call “knowledge” occupies a broad spectrum of degrees of uncertainty, and that very little – if anything – is absolutely certain.
This creates a dichotomy between Nietzsche’s pointing at the intellectual “piety” underlying modern science and Russell’s almost utopian vision of scientific progress. His writings state that, ‘In this world we can now begin a little to understand things, and a little to master them by help of science and help us to get over this craven fear in which mankind has lived for so many generations.’ Russel’s writings also show the origins of modern atheist tropes (imaginary supports, allies in the sky and so on).
Nevertheless, Russel’s autobiography relates a mystical experience in which “The ground seemed to give way beneath me and I found myself in quite another region,” he wrote. “Within five minutes I went through such reflections as the following: the loneliness of the human soul is unendurable; nothing can penetrate it except the highest intensity of the sort of love that religious teachers have preached; whatever does not spring from this motive is harmful, or at best useless; it follows that war is wrong, that a public school education is abominable, that the use of force is to be deprecated, and that in human relations one should penetrate to the core of loneliness in each person and speak to that.”
Despite this powerful experience, Bertrand Russel boxed the experience away from his philosophical position on religion. Russell tended to treat “religion” as either a body of doctrines to be intellectually analyzed, or as a phenomenon to be observed objectively from the outside. In the first case, Russell found flawed arguments; in the second, flawed institutions perpetrating violence and oppression.  A biographer noted that Russel tended to see only the best of science and only the worst of religion.

• Luther Burbank. Botanist. Luther is another person who the ‘Freethinker/Skeptic’ community claim to be solidly in the atheistic camp though the truth is not on their side.
The Freedom From Religion Foundation website portrays Luther Burbank as a clearly atheistic person. It attributes quotes such as “There is no use now talking evolution to these people. Their ears are stuffed with Genesis.” to display his sentiments towards Christians following the Scopes ‘Monkey Trial.’ Then they offer; “In 1926, an interview about Luther Burbank’s freethought views appeared in the San Francisco Bulletin, which headlined it: “I’m an Infidel, Declares Burbank, Casting Doubt on Soul Immortality Theory.” The article was reprinted around the world, creating shockwaves. Burbank was inundated with mostly critical letters, which he felt he had to reply to personally. Friend and later biographer, Wilbur Hale, attributed Burbank’s hastened death to the exertion of his replies: “He died, not a martyr to truth, but a victim of the fatuity of blasting dogged falsehood.” A crowd estimated at 100,000 came to Luther’s memorial, and heard the openly atheistic and ringing tribute by Judge Lindsay of Denver, Colorado. California still celebrates Luther Burbank’s birthday as Arbor Day, planting trees in his memory.”
That account of the funeral is directly contradicted by the funeral description available at website https://cemeterytravel.com/2013/12/04/cemetery-of-the-week-117-luther-burbanks-gravesite/view , “Judge Ben B. Lindsey of Denver gave a funeral oration at Burbank’s funeral to a crowd that was estimated at 10,000. He expanded on Burbank’s Unitarian rejection of a god of fire and brimstone. He said, “Luther Burbank lives forever in the myriad fields of strengthened grain, in the new forms of fruits and flowers and plants and vines and trees and above all the newly watered gardens of the human mind from whence shall spring human freedom from those earthly fields that shall drive out gods, false and brutal.”
The assertation that Luther Burbank was atheistic is greatly contradicted by Bertrand’s own opinions.  In LUTHER.BURBANK, “OUR BELOVED”, by Frederick W. Clampett (1926) the following quotes are directly attributed to Burbank:
• “I belong to the great church that holds the world within its starlit aisles; that claims the great and the good of every race and clime; that finds with joy the grain of gold in every creed, and floods with light and love the germs of good in every soul.”
• Over the entrance of such a church, Burbank said, and it will appeal to vast millions, may be written the name of the God of science.
• An atheist denies the existence of God. But an infidel is simply a disbeliever in the established religion.
The (In)famous 1926 article featured by the FFRF (above) ended in the following passage: Religion cannot be founded on a principle; it needs the power of an Eternal Energy, almighty and omnipresent. Burbank had already made that point clear when he said : “I prefer and claim the right to worship the infinite, everlasting, almighty God of this vast universe as revealed to us gradually, step by step, by the demonstrable truths of our savior, science.”
Luther did receive thousands of letters attacking his ‘atheism’. However, Clampett offers the following in response: “It is true he was an atheist in his utter denial of the God of the theologians, but that denial makes his faith all the stronger in the God of science.”  The cause of Burbank’s death was a heart attack followed by gastrointestinal complications.  There is a possibility that a latent condition was aggravated by the stress of reading (and replying to selected individuals) the thousands of letters he received.  The FFRF account is the only one citing the flood of mail as the cause of Luther’s death.
One Eternal Energy! One Infinite Spirit! There will you find the foundation of his faith, the one Supreme Source of the philosophy of his life. And this Infinite Energy is the very life of the world, the inspiration of all things created. It is the idea of God, as revealed to us from the “Kingdom within.” God is immanent, Burbank believed. “In Him we live, and have our being.” This Infinite Spirit was to him not a personality living in a distant realm, enthroned like a king, dispensing His authority. He is a part of everything created.
Luther was sure that, “…humanity, as time goes on, will picture in his soul God, the spirit whose moral attributes transcend to infinity his own highest ideals of goodness. He will image the Spirit of Light and Love and Truth an all-loving Being so close to the poorest of his creatures that no go-between is needed.” And as the “Kingdom within” develops those moral attributes, it will reveal glimpses into new depths of the eternal qualities of love, of mercy, of kindness, of peace, of harmony and health.. Under Jewish teaching, where racial religion was supreme, there was a “Holy of Holies.” But in the words of Jesus: “Neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father. . . . God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.”
It appears that Luther was indeed a theist, possibly a pantheist (in the Hindu sense), but his idea of drawing closer to God through scientific research was quite different than the prevailing notion of the Judeo-Christian God in America at that time. However, they appear to be very much in line with Gregor Mendel and other Catholic monks, priests and nuns for the past 1,600-2000 years of Christianity. To know God, study Creation. He left hints and clues throughout; from the smallest quantum particle to the incredible vastness of the cosmos.
As this post has proven to be far longer than originally planned, this author shall carry on from this point next week.

I’ve noticed that atheists on twitter have been confusing and conflating the burden of proof, a convention for debates, with a more general principle of epistemic hygiene. By epistemic hygiene, I mean taking care to believe true things and disbelieve in false things.
The argument goes something like this: If you don’t follow the burden of proof, you’ll be obligated to believe EVERYTHING, even absurd things without evidence. Now, this is two distinct ideas that have been conflated and tangled. One is whether someone is obligated in general to prove their claims (he is not). The other is what claims should you believe?
Following the right policies and judgments with what you believe is proper epistemic hygiene. Now this is where it gets interesting. Many important things are believed not on the basis of someone explaining the evidence for their existence, but by a direct ‘grasping’ or ‘seeing’ of them with the intellect. However, this ability can be broken, either in general or in certain circumstances. So the question is then, what can we grasp with certainty?
We can grasp things with certainty if we can ‘see’ the truth of them with the mind and have a web of beliefs that support that grasping. This web of beliefs can indeed be inspected by discourse, and the broad discourse of the wise is the standard of which it should be tested.
We cannot affirm all of our beliefs as individuals, but must look at the total work of all of humanity through time to come to reasonable certainty on anything.

“There’s no such thing as truth, epistemologically speaking.”
This is the response I got in response to mentioning that discourse is one of the best ways we have to find truth. From context, it seems to me that this means that we cannot know truth, or more generously, that we can’t know if we can know truth.
If first is the case, then everything reduces to language games and wisps of thought and beliefs without ground. We can’t know truth, so why believe in anything? Selecting belief systems for taste, or power, or arbitrarily is just as good.
If second is the case, that doesn’t free us of our moral obligation to know the truth to the best of our abilities. It may be the case that we can’t know truth, but it is a better life to live as though we can know what truth is.

Evidence is what gives a belief justification. There are many types of evidence, and the quality of evidence will depend both on the belief in question and what other beliefs you have. Physical evidence is only one kind of evidence. Not all evidence is repeatably verifiable, either. Some examples of non-physical evidence include the testimony of experts, direct experience and memory. All of our experience isn’t repeatable, and experience is one of the best justifications we have for our beliefs.
A proof or argument is what connects specific pieces of evidence to some claim. Arguments and proofs aren’t evidence, but they connect evidence to the claim being supported.
The “burden of proof” is merely a convention of how certain discussions happen. It is not a rule of logic or a general obligation. I much prefer the Socratic standard: When you’re in a conversation, do your best to speak truth and help find errors of the people you’re speaking with.
If you don’t accept that the person making the claim has to prove their claim, you are under no obligation to belief anything without evidence. There are many types of evidence, some of which you already have at hand that you can use to test their claim using your own reasoning.
When someone makes a claim, you can also simply withhold judgment. There is no reason that you are obligated to believe or disbelieve. However, if they are making an error, it is helpful and respectful to point out how they are making an error and why you believe that it is indeed an error.

Title: Response To ‘Freethinker’ Propaganda…Part 3

Do freethinkers have any meaning in life?  Though Dan Barker is accurate to an extent, he side-steps the ‘Big Question’ when he answers this question by saying; “Freethinkers know that meaning must originate in a mind.  Since the universe is mindless and the cosmos does not care, you must care, if you wish to have purpose. Individuals are free to choose, within the limits of humanistic morality.  “Some freethinkers find meaning in human compassion, social progress, the beauty of humanity (art, music, literature), personal happiness, pleasure, joy, love, and the advancement of knowledge”
It is true that the stars and planets, asteroids and nebulae, have no consciousness and therefore care not a whit what happens on or to our little blue marble.  That however, does not mean there is no greater meaning in life.  The things lists as ‘Freethinker Meaning of Life’ ar nothing more than hobbies, interests, or personal goals at the most.  His very short treatment of the ‘meaning of life’ for ‘freethinkers’ contains something that the most devout/dogmatic religious person would enjoy.  To claim such shallow items as a purpose for existence is ridiculous at best.
The phrase ‘Meaning of Life’ implies a universality that is absent in any laundry list of hobbies and interests.  The ‘I Likes’ you put on a dating profile are as variable as each unique individual completing the form.  The passions and interests, the tastes and dislikes for each person are not interchangeable between individuals or even the same person at different ages.  Each person’s tastes or passions are malleable because our priorities and goals change with the accumulation of experiences and years.  The clubbing or mountaineering one lived for in their youth becomes an impossibility once children enter their lives and/or age and arthritis have sapped their vitality.
The “Meaning of Life Question” has been approached in every civilization by everyone from peasants to princes.  Dan’s answers are shallow and weak in comparison to even the Atheistic Buddhism approved by Communist China.  True Zen Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism, Judaism, Christianity and even the polytheists/ascetics of early Western cultures are all far deeper than the Communist version because they consider the relationship of each human, not only with each other and the world, but also with the cosmos/divine.
Regardless of how ‘freethinkers’ feel about psychotherapy and its origins, the atheistic pioneer of the field, Sigmund Freud said it bluntly:   “… only religion can answer the question of the purpose of life. One can hardly be wrong in concluding that the idea of life having a purpose [at all] stands and falls with the religious system” (Civilization and Its Discontents, 1930).
The value society places on human life is born from the near-universal religious idea that human life is valuable or sacred.  The rules of polite society are likewise born from religious morals.  The loss or banning of religion from society has frequently been shown to produce enormous loss of life (for the good of society/collective) or relativistic permissibility that allows the individual to do almost anything they find ‘fulfilling’.
Dan claims the complexity of life does not require a designer.  He states that the explanation for the complexity of biological life is Darwin’s theory of evolution because cumulative nonrandom natural selection “designing” for billions of years, has provided the explanation.
Even granting the possibility that random mutations (99.99999….% of which are lethal or deleterious) are the source of all species of plant or animal on the planed from a single, common, one-celled ancestor, there is still the issue of a living organism somehow (defying the laws of everything from entropy to biology) arising spontaneously from non-living matter.
Genetic drift within species and the results of selective breeding are incontrovertible.  Even with guided experiments to prove bacterial evolution running for decades, there has never been a documented case of bacteria giving rise to anything but bacteria of the same species.  It may be with slightly different traits that may lead to a different strain or subspecies, but it is still the same type of bacteria.  Never has it been documented that even a single celled species gave rise to any other single-celled species, let alone a multi-celled creature.  Human-guided selective breeding (compressing millions of years of natural selection into a few decades) has produced over a hundred breeds of dogs that theoretically came from a common wolf-like ancestor.  The offspring of all this selection are still all distinctly canines, though the argument could be made that a teacup poodle is a different species than a great dane, just as the zebra and horse are.  Even so, those species are still in the same genus.
If, as Dan Barker claims, the ‘Freethinker’ relies on their intellect to form opinions about subjects on the basis of reason, independently of tradition, authority, or established belief, why does he not dismiss the theory of evolution, with the massive need for faith (in Darwin’s theory and those of all of his scientific descendants) required to not dismiss the seemingly outlandish theories involved?
The materialistic/naturalistic claim that random molecular reactions somehow produced a living cell that somehow became all life on earth through random recombination of genetic material (thinned by natural selection) requires tremendous faith (odds against this are on the order of an untrained monkey typing out a Shakespeare play with zero errors when placed in front of a typewriter on the first try).  Why are there no skeptical treatments or demands for logical or material proof of some sort to support the theory?  There is more substantial documentation for the theory of Race Realism than there is for random mutation transforming aquatic algae into ferns; ferns into broadleaved flowering plants that themselves were transformed into everything from a violet to 100-foot-tall tropical trees.  Then continued by converting broad-leafed plants into grass and needle-leafed conifers (ranging from alpine bristlecone pines to giant redwoods) and cacti with their leaves converted into spines.
Why do skeptics, rationalists and freethinkers accept evolution without question and overlook the issues surrounding primal aquatic animals somehow arising out of algae?  Why is there no question surrounding the notion of fish and mollusk species with distinct physical attributes changing into another creature with traits that are distinctly different from the original, with no evidence of transitional or divergent phases?  Why do these rationalist groups embrace the notion that, after millions of years of adaptation to the aquatic environment, animals somehow converted themselves to life on land, which would require massive physiological and structural changes?  Then there are the ages of reptiles, followed by dinosaurs in their many forms, then tiny, mouse-like mammals arising suddenly out of non-mammals, the megafauna in the ice ages and those species changing into what we now see.
Rational thought indicates that the massive changes to chromosome numbers, sequences and length to produce the wildly divergent flora and fauna in the fossil record, even over the massive lengths of time involved require some form of guidance.
Yet Dan claims that a “Divine Designer” is not the answer because the complexity of such a creature would be subject to the same scrutiny itself, basing his argument in the notion that a creator must be of equal or greater complexity than the creation.  To support this attitude, he states that, ‘Even a child knows to ask: “If God made everything, then who made God?”’; thereby treating God like a material creature, bound by the same laws that govern the universe.
What atheists fail to consider is the builder of any construct cannot originate from inside the construct.  Space and time, matter and energy originated from the Big Bang.  The creator, by definition, must then exist outside of space and time as we perceive those concepts.  Just as a builder can enter and modify or customize a structure, or a person can customize their ‘simworld’ to their liking, the creator can enter and modify the universe.
What we call ‘God’ is a perfect, all-seeing, all-knowing, all loving consciousness that created the universe and keeps it running.  Just as any picture can be zoomed in to the extent that it breaks down into pixels, matter breaks down into quantum particles.  All matter is made of quantum particles that do not exist except as a mathematical probability unless they are observed.  What could have been observing those particles, keeping them in physical form so they could combine into physical sub-atomic particles and maintain them in that state for 13.8 billion years?
Because of quantum particle behavior, Elon Musk (hardly a conspiracy nut or fundamentalist Christian) has launched a project to determine whether the universe is a computer simulation, with the Computer providing the constant observation needed to maintain physicality.  The far simpler answer, with the fewest steps, is that this universe is a creation of and exists within the infinite mind of the very being of existence.  The observation to maintain quantum particles is provided by God, not some supercomputer AI.

Dan Barker quotes “Clarence Darrow as saying, I don’t believe in God because I don’t believe in Mother Goose” as validation for ‘Freethinkers’’ holding a naturalistic worldview.  Apparently Clarence did not hear the Paul Harvey radio program “The Rest of the Story” about the existence of the actual ‘Mother Goose’ who lived in the Massachusetts Colony during the Elizabethan Era.  Therefore, given the rationalist/freethinker belief that if a statement is falsifiable it must be rejected, Clarence Darrow, and all who adhere to his rejection of God, must now reject that reason for their dogmatic atheism.
According to Dan Barker; “To be a ‘freethinker’ one must confine reality to what is directly perceivable through the ‘freethinker’s’ natural senses or ‘reason’.  ‘Reason’ confines the truth of a statement to the strict tests of the scientific method.  To be true, a statement must be testable and have repeated tests confirm the validity of the statement. It must also be parsimonious (the simplest explanation with the fewest assumptions) and be logical (free of contradiction, non-sequiturs and irrelevant ad-hominem character attacks.”
To adhere to the ‘freethinkers’ paradigm, then the freethinkers must reject the scientific method, logic and many other abstract concepts that have no physical, testable presence.  They must also reject any and all emotions because they also are immaterial, untestable, and irrational.  For the ‘freethinkers’ to allow themselves to use anything that cannot be subjected to their standards automatically refutes their claims of being a member of that group because it contradicts their standards.
For ‘freethinkers’ to base their morality on humanism (People who don’t subscribe to any religion self-identify as Humanists.  Humanism is a worldview that emphasizes the value of humanity and social justice while altogether rejecting supernatural concepts and religious dogma) and/or not hurting others, is not a solid base upon which to build a healthy civilization.  The USSR and other Soviet-Inspired states were built upon humanist/scientific secular designs.
On 11/17/10 Brandon Norgaard posted in his website The Enlightened Worldview Project that his “…phenomenological and scientific reasoning has led me to the conclusion that people have the natural rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  While many Americans and others in Western Democracies might wish to mockingly congratulate Brandon for catching up with John Locke or Thomas Jeffeson, they should hear him out.  He did not arrive at his conclusion from the Judeo-Christian perspective, but as secular humanist.
According to him, “This reasoning is rooted in the realization of the nonphysical aspect of humanity, which is called the soul. There is also an important realization that souls have free will, which is a supernatural concept because there are no natural processes through which all actions of souls, and by extension humans, can be reduced to. Finally there is the realization that the first person experience of right and wrong has a nonphysical aspect as well.”
He refutes Dan Barker’s position of ‘Freethinker’s Morality’ of reason and kindness by stating, “…there is no way that morality, and by extension natural justice, can be real aspects of the universe regardless of anyone’s mere personal opinion unless they are based on some form of nonphysical metaphysics. Quite simply, if everything that exists is physical, then there is no inherent right or wrong, there is just the way things are. The physical universe is not at all concerned with social justice or humanity per se.”
This writer wonders, therefore;  How can any atheist that claims to be a humanist even pretend to criticize a theist on the ‘morality’ of God or religion when such criticism relies on an non-existent cosmic absolute and is done in an unkind and unreasonable manner.  The sheer hypocrisy of atheist freethinkers utilizing an objective moral standard (whose existence they deny) to condemn others people, not to mention the Creator of the Universe, is staggering, particularly morality does not exist as a physical, testable entity subject to empirical analysis?
Brandon Norgaard also states, “Secular Humanism is not a coherent worldview in essence. A worldview that includes belief in a nonphysical aspect of the self is more rational and I believe more justified given the scientific and phenomenological evidence.”  While this embrace of a transcendent consciousness certainly not confirm the existence of God as Western Civilization views that entity, Brandon does not rule out some form of Creator.  Rather, he requires one when he states, “I do not reject belief in anything supernatural because the natural universe is not an explanation for itself. The best explanation is that the natural universe was created by something that is over and above nature, and this is a supernatural concept.”
 
Though Brandon repudiates known mainstream religions when he states, “This concept may be called God, but this does not mean that for one to believe this that they must have blind faith in God as a Christian or Muslim does. There is a reasonable justification for believing this and thus blind faith is not necessary. This is one strike against the Secular Humanist worldview.”
When Dan Barker claims that morality can be based on human need or ‘doing no harm’ to any person, it can sound very fine and dandy.  However, when real world scenarios are tried, they become capricious and arbitrary.  When humans become the masters of the rules, the in group often becomes favored in catalogue of one-way rules such as those seen in any absolute rule society from the dawn of monarchy in the Tigris and Euphrates valleys through socialist dictatorships around the world from 1917 until now.
By basing morality on ‘human needs’, not imagined ‘cosmic absolutes, Dan’s essay comes into direct contradiction with Brandon’s statements, as well as those of the vast majority of theists.  The physiological needs of prison inmates are objectively met. .They have no job and therefore an abundance of free time, free food and drink, free cable and internet, free dental and medical care, etc.  According to many activists on the political left, that should equate to paradise.  Yet nearly all the prisoners in any jail or prison would take cold, wet, hungry and free over their relatively comfortable life in confinement.
The transcendent human soul, a high melding of intellect and will, has been known for thousands of years to need a purpose.  For much longer, each individual human has sought to find their own meaning or goal in life beyond the mere animal drives of survival and reproduction.  Their quests have, in large part, succeeded or failed based on how hard each person was willing to work and sacrifice to achieve their goal.  The impacts of these goals on human society have depended upon the extent to which they abided within the bounds of both societal written law and the natural law freethinkers as so quick to deny.
According to Dan Barker, “Moral dilemmas involve a conflict of values, requiring a careful use of reason to weigh the outcome…Freethinkers try to base actions on their consequences to real, living human being.”  This writer states unequivocally that such attitudes have been used throughout history to legitimize atrocities.  The enslavement of captives and criminals in both Europe and the Americas was legitimized by arguing that their lives were better in bondage than in cells or primitive squalor.  The euthanasia movements, both in the past and now, base their arguments on the notion that the lives of the insane, disabled, elderly or terminally ill are a burden both to themselves and others; therefore it is a mercy to all to end their lives.  The abortion movement and Planned Parenthood argue that careless, recreational sex is a good thing, and that such activities should be without consequences.  After all, burdening an unwed woman with an unplanned or unwanted pregnancy is terrible.  The fetus would have a life of want and poverty.  Therefore terminating the pregnancy is just.  For the woman or girl it is a simple procedure and life returns to normal.
“Freethinkers argue that religion promotes a dangerous and inadequate “morality” based on blind obedience, unexamined ultimatums, and “pie-in-the-sky” rewards of heaven or gruesome threats of hell,” Dan Barker argues.  That statement sounds like Dan made just the type of absolutist statement of condemnation he accuses religion of making.
Rather than make more cheap hypocrisy points, this author will direct Dan Barker to the sciences and reason he is so fond of.  These fields of study were preserved and promoted by the Catholic Religious Orders, both male and female.  The Catholic Church has believed for two thousand years that God is both rational and orderly.  Those characteristics are discernable in His creations and to learn about these creations is to learn about God.  The authors of the renaissance were not the ‘protestant reformers.’  Rather, they were the Catholic Religious Orders that opened educational institutions for children and adults.  They were the monks and nuns who studied reason, medicine, logic, mathematics, genetics and astronomy and shared their findings with the public through institutions of learning, hospitals, orphanages and charity.  Galileo did not get into his feud with the Pope over his heliocentric theory.  It was because his arrogance led him to publicly break a promise he had made to the Pope.
The ‘dangerous and inadequate’ morality built on ‘blind obedience’ Dan Barker condemns seems to be a cartoonish slave state of fundamentalist Islam blended with the worst of Fundamentalist Puritanism displayed during the Salem Witch Trials.  It bears no resemblance to true Christianity or any other mainstream Western or Asian theistic religion or philosophy when the true teachings are embodied though the believer’s behavior.
In an earlier post, I noted that Dan is making his anti-religious arguments from the comforts of a civilization built, maintained and protected by a Christian ethos.  The laws and unwritten expectations were based on Christian morals.  Murder and theft, for example, were always wrong.  Now, though, as relativism and other ‘freethinking’ ethics have entered the judicial systems of Western Civilization, the ethical standards are being rapidly eroded away by those unfettered by an absolute morality.  ‘Laws/Rules for thee, but not for me’ has become almost a given in personal, business and social media conduct.
As the population looks back through time to when our civilization exercised the rules of self-restraint and delayed gratification, our civilization was more polite.  When criminal behavior and unwed motherhood/fatherhood were both scandalous and rare, what do we see?  We see absolute rules, codes of conduct that applied to all in equal measure.  For millennia these rules were in place through all cultures, all over the world, in every civilization to some extent.  Also, when these rules were flagrantly disobeyed, that civilization (from Babylon to Rome to Pre-Revolutionary France to Nazi Germany and Communist/Socialist regimes) declined and fell, often violently.

Title: Are ‘Freethinkers/Skeptics’ Really Living Up To Their Names?
Author: Admin
Link: https://www.redpillreligion.com/2017/10/11/freethinkersskeptics-really-living-names/
Category: Skeptical of Skeptics
Date: October 11, 2017
Entry: 
Based on what I have read in most ‘Freethinker’ and ‘Skeptic’ websites and social site posts, the labels ‘freethinker’ and ‘skeptic’ are often more of a self-compliment that an accurate title.  In this brief essay, I will use the term ‘Freethinker’ to describe both of these groups.
Many self-described Freethinkers assume (like Dan Barker appears to in his essay “What is a Freethinker” [click here]) that their intellect “…forms opinions about religion on the basis of reason, independently of tradition, authority, or established belief.  Freethinkers include atheists, agnostics and rationalists.”  This attitude seems objectively self-contradictory.  It calls itself ‘free’ while simultaneously mandating that any inquiry through ‘reason and evidence’ must reject any and all notion of the Divine.  Does not the mandatory rejection of religion form a ‘tradition’ based upon the ‘authority’ of prior ‘Free-Thinkers’ in and of itself form an ‘established belief’?
As Dr. Jordon B. Peterson has noted about the high-visibility atheists such as Sam Harris, the Freethinkers, skeptics et al. are daily taking advantage of Christian Civilization.  Western Europe was founded upon Christianity, particularly Catholicism.  The Catholic Church preserved the Classical theories and thought from Greco-Roman Civilization.  Catholicism preserved and encouraged learning, built science as a way to pursue knowledge of the Creator (though learning about His Creation).  Pursuit of science (including creating the scientific method) was the work of monks and priests.  Religious orders (monks, priests and nuns) were the driving force behind creating hospitals, universities and even education for all.
All of the virtues, and desirable behaviors listed in Dan Barker’s “Free Thinker} essay are in reality Christian virtues. They were unwelcome in Communist/Atheist nations in Eastern Europe, Africa, southeast Asia and Latin America–such as honesty, or sanctity of human life, for example–if they would not be in the Party’s interest.  They are still most unwelcome in communist/socialist nations such as Cuba, China and North Korea for the same reason. They were also unwelcome in Nazi Germany or Mussolini’s Italy.
The “Freethinkers” also seem to be nice, but, outside of a Christian context, “Nice” is nothing more than a vague platitude. It is a highly subjective term about a subjective idea. Nice means almost nothing when it comes to behavior.
Any steadfast adherence to a given belief without sufficient evidence is contradictory to the idea of ‘Free Thought’ as Dan Barker describes it.  Yet those who attach themselves to that label deliberately close their eyes, ears and minds to the abundant evidence for the existence of a Creator.  Astronomers have dated the Universe as being approximately 14 billion years old.  Therefore everything about the universe (time, space, matter and energy) had a beginning.  By definitions, there was nothing before the instant when the singularity occurred. The rules of logic, from which we can determine the laws governing time, matter and space mandate that nothing can spontaneously appear from nothing. Therefore, the very existence of the universe requires a Creator that exists outside of time and space because a Creator cannot originate from inside its own creation.
Even allowing a spontaneous ‘singularity’ from which all matter, time, energy and space originated, the incredibly narrow tolerance for the laws governing the universe argue for a Creator. The balance between strong and weak nuclear forces (which allow the elements to react and interact as they do) and gravity is so precise that the odds of it happening through mere chance have been calculated as 1:(10 to the power of ten to the power of 123).
This makes the odds of everything in the universe forming so blindingly small, that anyone with free thought must question why does anything even exist?  Unless the ‘free thinker’ has already closed their mind to the possibility of a Creator (which would prove they are not free thinkers), they must at least honestly consider that possibility.
Additionally, the odds of the nuclear forces, gravity, electromagnetism, the weight and energy balances between protons and electrons and all the other factors necessary for the current universe, capable of sustaining life, to exist are analogous to giving a single monkey a word processor and it immediately typing Shakespeare’s Hamlet without a single error.
‘Freethinkers’ and ‘Skeptics’ congratulate themselves and each other for their reason and logic.  Yet they consistently choose to ignore the mounting evidence for a Creator and to cling to their faith in random chance as the sole cause of the universe and life. They hold and spout their dogma of Random Chance creating highly organized galaxies (composed of hundreds of millions of stars, many with planets that may even host life) spontaneously formed (in contradiction to the law of Entropy) from the matter that was randomly created from the wild energy and chaos resulting from the Big Bang, when nothing became something in direct contradiction of both logic and the laws of physics.

Atheists lie and say they are not an idelogical movement, that it’s rare for people to leave Atheism, that Atheists have higher IQs, are better at science, are less likely to go to jail, are more mentally healthy, and are just the default rational human beings. These are all lies.

Please support our work via Paypal or Bitcoin or Patreon. Atheists make a lot of claims on science, but what’s so funny about it is how few scientists will back up many of the claims they make, and how few scientists are actually Atheists.  Indeed, Atheists are a minority among scientists even in places like China, where Atheism is rigorously enforced by the government, and most Nobel laureates in fields like Physics are Christians even today, with a good representation from believing practicing Jews and some other religions. And that’s because belief in God is rational and useful in a field like Physics, and is well-evidenced!

Atheism is no longer just the average person who decides they don’t believe in God or don’t find the evidence for God they’ve seen so far convincing. It is now an ideological hate movement and cult ideology, rooted originally in Marxist thought but now embraced by many libertarians and “conservative” right-wingers. The cult gets by by simply lying about the evidence wherever the find it.
In reality we have evidence in multiple fields in science. So to kick off an ongoing series we’re dubbing “Atheists Always Lie,” we will look at just one of the areas where we have evidence for God in contemporary mainstream science: Near Death Experience.

Jordon Peterson discusses why it’s easy to bash Christianity and why it doesn’t make you smart. Lively discussion of preserving not well explained heritage is important, the possible escaping the responsibilities that Christian lays on people, the meaning of sacrifice ancient and modern. He segues into the idea that idea of personal sacrifice to a benevolent God is a frightening concept. He finishes by saying the bashing of Christianity at the level of universities is a terrible thing. The level of cynicism is completely anti-humanity.  Segement is about 10 minutes long and video starts at close to the beginning.

Definitions:
Def 1: A contingent being is a being such that if it exists, could have not-existed or could cease to exist.
Def 2: A necessary being (or non-contingent being) is a being such that if it exists, cannot not-exist (and therefore could not not-have-existed and cannot cease to exist).
Note: I use ground-reason essentially to do the work of the German Grund, a word which neither the English “ground” nor “reason” sufficiently captures in meaning, since it unites the sides of being and knowing, the ontological and the epistemological, in one.
The Argument 
1. A contingent being C exists.

As philosopher Edward Feser has pointed out, some atheists are simply not intellectually serious. They may be very ignorant or uneducated, directly dishonest, deeply confused, ill-informed, willfully obtuse, ideologically dogmatic, or just plain stupid; the end result is the same: it is not possible or fruitful to have a serious, rational discussion about God with such people. Here are some red flags which will alert you that you are dealing with an intellectually dishonest or defective atheist:

Listen as Sy Garte, a professor of biochemistry and Max Kolbe discuss the journey that led Sy out of atheism. 
Max opens the interview by asking Sy his childhood. Sy responds that he was raised in a very religious household, but the normal religion. Sy was a “red diaper baby”.  Born to  the son of atheists who actively promoted communism in the 1950s and 1960’s, his childhood experience is one of indifference to active hostility to religion.

Rob mentions that Mr. Spark, a regular commenter and fan, requested that Deflating Atheism and Max Kolbe take on a response video by Professor Stick. Professor Stick responded to a short video of Professor Alister McGrath, an atheist molecular bio-physicist who eventually became a Christian. Before watching clips of Professor Stick’s response video, Max Kolbe discusses Professor McGrath’s background in more detail. Rob and Max discuss the potential difficulties of the format and they begin the video.

Editor’s note: this is our first letter in what we hope to be an ongoing series. Thanks Steve B, for your thoughtful email!
But [..my letter..] does concern your fine, interesting show, which provides a refreshing break from the shallow reductionist materialism of most of your opposing counterparts. The show’s take-no-prisoners, gruff approach, I feel, is exactly what the doctor ordered as a reply to the aggressiveness of so many of the “new” atheists. One issue I’d like to bring up is the question of how to communicate the idea of non-material reality to those who claim that matter is a universal fact of being, a stance, which by nature, cannot allow for the existence of, and evidence for, spiritual realities, entities, and “realms”.

Max Kolbe and Missing the Mark discuss why the Escaping Atheism occasionally (or frequently) uses vulgar and caustic language.  [Warning: Following video has adult language starting at 3:00.]

Max Kolbe introduces the video with defining Escaping Atheism’s mission of secular criticism of atheism. He mentions the question he’s received from more than one Christian of why social media interactions involve swearing at times.
Conversation between Missing the Mark and Max breaks in where Max discusses places and times where the culture is rough and tumble, ie, the wild west, inner cities, and rough suburban neighborhoods.
Max mentions that Christians have no obligation to meet the culture in the same rough style. He also acknowledges that vulgar language can make people look juvenile.
Max then discusses his freshman year at Catholic school and his homeroom teacher, who freely swore in the classroom. He enthusiastically discusses the frank language used by his St. Augustine monk with specific examples. Offers several examples of American Catholic sub-cultures that swear frequently. Ends the segment mentioning that the use of vulgar language is not directly considered wrong/sinful and that no one has an obligation to use words that make them uncomfortable.

Entry: 
Escaping Atheism stated mission, in addition to using swear words on a regular basis, is to an attempt to help people ‘escape atheism’. But what do we even mean by atheism?
To avoid pointless dictionary thumping, these are the definitions of important words at the Escaping Atheism project. If you can use these words as defined, welcome! We know what it’s like to honestly wonder if there’s no God. If you can’t use these words as defined here, well, expect to be cussed at some point.
Escaping Atheism definitions:

atheism=denial or disbelief of God (traditional definition of atheism – etymology of atheism)
agnosticism=does not know, does not have a declared position either way; although they may have bias or leaning
theism=belief in God (or gods), although not necessarily religious or spiritual or part of any organized religion
God=uncreated Creator of reality, not part of the natural world in any sense, no claims about the nature of the uncreated Creator of reality unless associated with a particular religious belief

As a human being who often struggles with relatively trivial difficulties in life, I have long felt admiration for Stephen Hawking’s courage and determination to continue working in spite of a highly-debilitating disease. As a physics enthusiast, I have the greatest respect for his accomplishments. But now, as a result of an article published in The Guardian two weeks ago, I also feel embarrassment for, and disappointment in, Hawking. The article reported his views on religion and metaphysics — they were unoriginal, ill-informed, biased, insensitive, and even arrogant.

Many people are mistaken about the etymology of the word “atheism.” They think it comes from an alpha-privative negation a- joined with theism, that is, they think
atheism  =  a- theism
or
atheism = the negation of theism
That is not where atheism comes from, however. ‘Atheism’ is in fact an older word than ‘theism.’  It comes originally from the Greek ἄθεος meaning ‘godless’ or ‘without god’.  The -ισμός is a later addition, which means “doctrine of” or “teaching of.”

Part 3 picks up the discussion with New Atheist Denial of History’s Professor Borden Painter with journalistic assumptions about religion.
Conversation continues backward in time with the section covering the Medieval/middle ages and Renaissance Period. Professor Painter mentions “Dark Ages” as Victorian term to describe the era as incorrect description. Professor Painter then discusses advances during the medieval era and the dated and distorted model of middle ages as nothing but unthinking superstition.

Something that doesn’t get a lot of attention today are actual atheistic arguments, arguments for the position “God does not exist.” This is the result of an odd situation that occurred in the mid-20th century in which atheists essentially did two things:
(1) they admitted their position could not be defended and gave up trying to do so, and
(2) they still did not abandon their indefensible position, but instead shifted their position to a much more defensible one, agnosticism—except they did not do this honestly and openly, but redefined ‘agnosticism’ and ‘atheism’ so that they two words are now supposed to mean essentially the same thing (despite the fact that ‘agnosticism’ had been coined in explicit contradistinction to atheism, and also despite the fact that the loud atheist minority did not bother to ask permission of the agnostics before forcibly co-opting their identity).
What are the arguments that God does not exist? How strong are they? There are only four, to my knowledge, and if you suspect they are not very strong, given that atheists themselves recognized their complete failure, you would be correct.

Over the past couple of years, I’ve been active on social media. In that time, I’ve discovered that many atheists are active on social media as well and they often target me for my views on Christianity. I’ve learned much about many of their views, so this article offers some arguments to present my views in the context of theirs.
One discovery I’ve made is that many want “evidence” for my faith in Christianity. They don’t want to hear that many of the two billion Christians in the world have strong personal testimonies. This “anecdotal” evidence, even when considered collectively, is not enough. I told them that I could collect testimonies from a thousand people in my church to create an empirical study using subjective content analysis, which would analyze themes and patterns. They reply that they need physical evidence. Of course, they know that I can’t produce physical evidence of the metaphysical.

Atheists often turn to science, yet not to all sciences…   Read more on Professor Thomason’s blog: https://sjthomason.wordpress.com/2016/12/22/a-christian-defense-against-atheism/

Max observes that like many militant atheists, Captain Capitalism comes from an authoritarian to possibly dysfunctional religious household and has gone no farther in resolving or separating religion from his experiences.

Entry: 
First ever Escaping Atheism hang out features our very own Andrew Stratelates and Max Kolbe. Max discusses his parent’s traditions of King James Bible fundamentalism on one side and Calvinist (Reform) Christianity on the other.  Andrew and Max explore the difference between modern evangelicalism and orthodox Christianity, which has an apostolic tradition. (Defined in the hangout)  The concept that accepting a belief alone brings salvation is linked to both atheism and evangelicalism.
Later in the hangout, Max and Andrew discuss rejecting the “traditions of men” as being a tradition itself, along with the hazards of attempting to read the Bible without greater context or education. Max also brings up evangelical young earth creationism.  Towards the very end, Andrew and Max offer praise for parts of modern evangelical culture including being the more prominent keepers of traditional Christian lifestyles.

He’ll call it “deconverting” because that’s the terminology his cult uses. Anyway, please do watch, and start paying attention to these people. They want to control your life and your kids’s life, and they lie when they say otherwise.

This is a response to Noel Plum’s YouTube video “Dean Esmay’s “Escaping Atheism” Project”.
Dear Noel,
Hi. I’m Eve Keneinan. I’m a philosopher by profession and an Orthodox Christian by way of adult conversion.  I’m also part of the Escaping Atheism project.  I know Dean Esmay, via the internet, but Escaping Atheism is more a volunteer confederation than a monarchy (we gave Dean the title “Patriarch”—I’m sure you can see why that’s funny), so this is just my thoughts on what you have to say.  Dean was one of the folks who proofread it, and had a couple corrections to the parts where I mention him, but this isn’t in any way from him.  It’s basically all me.  Sorry I couldn’t answer you on YouTube, but I don’t really make YouTube videos (unless occasional screen captures count), so my blog will have to do.  I’m afraid I didn’t work out whether this was going to be a commentary on what you had to say or a reply where I spoke directly to you, so it ended up a bit of both. I’m going to offer some critiques of some of your points, agree with you sometimes, and sometimes when you particularly address Dean, just not say anything at all.

Title: Atheism Cult’s Catalog of Anti-Theist Psychological Tactics (draft two)

Category: Atheist Challenges
Date: October 30, 2016
Entry: 
Inspired from a classic MRA document, the Catalog of Anti-Male Shaming tactics,”  this is the first draft of a hopefully growing list of rote-response Talking Points used by Atheism cultists routinely to shift the subject away from the dogmatic, unproven, pseudoscience and/or pseudohistory peddled by the modern Atheism cult.
If Atheism is not a movement why do they have logos?
To be clear, these are things that routinely come out of Atheist mouths these days. I am open to input for any I have missed. The list may also benefit from categorization–this is a second draft for public scrutiny, the first, with little difference, is on my blog –DE
Scripted Robotic Atheist Comments – Draft Two:
You’re simpleminded and childish.
I don’t believe in your particular Sky fairy I understand Science!
You have an Imaginary Friend you call God or whatever.
You’re in denial about reality.
You’re just afraid to die.
You can’t accept that Science has defeated your Bronze Age superstition.
No matter what you say, Evolution is still right!
Learn Science! Didn’t anyone tell you about the Big Bang?
You don’t want to give up your cherished beliefs
You’re bitter because Atheism is now popular and your religion is dying.
All religion is dying science has triumphed over it and that makes you afraid.
You just want people’s minds to be controlled.
You’re afraid to think for yourself.
You’re exaggerating the hatefulness of Atheism.
You’re paranoid about Atheists and see Atheists everywhere.
I’m not even an Atheist! I’m just agnostic/apatheist/Christian who agrees with all Atheism cult Talking Points.

You just want your religion in charge of everything.
You just hate that anyone is having sex without your permission.
You hate gays and want to control/convert/brainwash/imprison/kill them.
You hate women and want to control them.
You hate all Atheists.
You’re delusional/crazy.
Real men don’t kneel to anyone or anything!
Independent minds worship nothing!
You just want to force women/men to get married and have children.
Your religion is scary: [insert random Futrellized Bible verse here]
Inquisitions
Witch hunts
Crusades
Religion creates war.
You’re one of those right-wing wackos.
You’re a closet commie.
You’re an extremist.
You sound like the KKK. The KKK was Christian and responsible for all the lynchings and racism.
Stop generalizing! Not All Atheists Are Like That!
That’s an anti-Atheist stereotype!
Why do you hate women?
You are insensitive to the plight of your religion’s victims!
You are mean-spirited.
You want to roll back civil rights of women!
You’re being rude and that makes me think I should avoid your religion.
Shouldn’t you be nice to people? Isn’t that what Jesus said?
You’re unstable.
You have issues.
You need therapy.
Weirdo!
You just want money for your religious scam.
How can you be so rude to someone who was abused by religious authority figures?
You were never really an Atheist.
You just don’t understand True Atheism.
I just worship one less god than you!
You have no evidence!
NB: More suggestions are welcome! –DE

Title: Disturbing questions to ask Atheists

Entry: 
At the prompting of they guys at the “Rome Is Burning” Show (please click here please go check them out). This is not a paid endorsement as we do not do any product endorsements at this time on Escaping Atheism (though we’re not opposed to it since Escaping Atheism is most assuredly NOT an authorized ministry of any Church).
So a few weeks ago I had an interesting conversation with Wil at Placeholder Films. I ran my mouth long as I often do, but it was an interesting conversation. I explained how I walked all the way from Atheism Central to Vatican City, but in the second half hour I had some questions for him that I was certain would convince a rational person that there is something intensely ideological and rather predictable about the way Atheists think. I was really pretty sure that with some reflection, almost all his answers were faith statements, or let’s call them sentiment. I got them all from conversations with Atheists and things I would sometimes think when I was an Atheist.
A lot of people found these questions and answers interesting so I’m pasting them below the video conversation we had. And we’re scheduled to talk with Wil again tomorrow around 2pm Eastern on his channel. Can’t wait!
Hey by the way please support us in work like this on Patreon, yo!

Here were the questions I asked this bright young man. Do you the listener/supporter or even critic/”skeptic” have suggestions on how to sharpen the questions? Because I think this informal experiment bears repeating for any Christians or members of other religions:
Answer Yes or No (or “lean mostly yes” or “lean mostly no”):
1 Atheism is not a belief, it’s lack of belief. It is totally non-ideological.
2 Atheism says nothing whatsoever about your personality or your views.
3 Atheism is about science, logic, reason, and evidence. Religion is the opposite of those things.
4 Atheism is about facts over feelings.
5 Atheism frees minds and teaches people how to think for themselves.
6 There is no evidence for God
7 Science is how we determine if things are true or not.
8 The reason we can trust science is that it frequently overturns itself if it turns out to be wrong.
9 Science is something that helps you overcome religion.
10 Religion is delusional or brainwashing.
11 Overcoming religion is a good thing because it’s backward superstition holding back human progress and enlightenment.
12 Skepticism is a scientific principle or is inherently scientific.
13 Occam’s Razor is a scientific principle or is inherently scientific.
14 If you see something that seems impossible, you must have imagined it or were always just fooled.
15 The laws of physics don’t change or, if they do, they only change in ways scientists can predict and measure.
16 The human mind is entirely a property or function or emergent effects of chemicals in the brain and/or Central Nervous System.
17 There are no forces, phenomena, or entities which exist outside of or apart from physical nature.
18 The laws of physics are explained by science.
19 If God exists, human beings are intelligent, wise, and moral enough to pass judgement on God’s actions and motives.
20 It is appropropriate to worry about the effects of religion on people, but there’s no reason to worry about Atheism.
(Prepared for a podcast.)

Update: Screen shot of original article before this update here: http://imgur.com/a/BuBlw
(Provided because Atheists tend to quickly pounce on any deviation as an act of bad faith):
Here is how I marked Wil’s answers:
1 Atheism is not a belief, it’s lack of belief. It is totally non-ideological. Yes
2 Atheism says nothing whatsoever about your personality or your views. Yes
3 Atheism is about science, logic, reason, and evidence. Religion is the opposite of those things. No/not
4 Atheism is about facts over feelings. Yes
5 Atheism frees minds and teaches people how to think for themselves. Neutral
6 There is no evidence for God. Yes
7 Science is how we determine if things are true or not. Yes
8 The reason we can trust science is that it frequently overturns itself if it turns out to be wrong. No
9 Science is something that helps you overcome religion. NO
10 Religion is delusional or brainwashing. Yes
11 Overcoming religion is a good thing because it’s backward superstition holding back human progress and enlightenment. Yes
12 Skepticism is a scientific principle or is inherently scientific. No (but core, needed)
13 Occam’s Razor is a scientific principle or is inherently scientific. Yes
14 If you see something that seems impossible, you must have imagined it or were always just fooled. NO
15 The laws of physics don’t change or, if they do, they only change in ways scientists can predict and measure. No* (quantum objection)
16 The human mind is entirely a property or function or emergent effects of chemicals. in the brain and/or Central Nervous System. Yes
17 There are no forces, phenomena, or entities which exist outside of or apart from physical nature. Yes
18 The laws of physics are explained by science. Yes
19 If God exists, human beings are intelligent, wise, and moral enough to pass judgement on God’s actions and motives. Yes
20 It is appropropriate to worry about the effects of religion on people, but there’s no reason to worry about Atheism. No
 
Once again Wil is not to be crucified for his responses (pun intended) because they were asked off the top of his head, the fact that they are general sentiment not ironclad ideas is accepted, where he took exception I noted he took some exception and you can decide what you think. But here were his answers. And any serious Non-Atheist would answer “No” to most or all these questions, and almost any Atheist would be predicted to lean “Yes” on most of them.
“Atheist/Skeptic/Rationalist” community you have an ideology problem and it’s quite glaring. Especially when you keep screaming that you can ‘t have one.
Wil’s answers:
—
1 Atheism is not a belief, it’s lack of belief. It is totally non-ideological. Yes
2 Atheism says nothing whatsoever about your personality or your views. Yes

7 Science is how we determine if things are true or not. Yes

9 Science is something that helps you overcome religion. No (some maybe)
10 Religion is delusional or brainwashing. Yes
11 Overcoming religion is a good thing because it’s backward superstition holding back human progress and enlightenment. Yes

Nowadays, atheists define their position as “lack of a belief in God or gods”. This definition itself is idiotic. By defining their position as lack of belief, that means that bricks, dust motes, and people in comas are atheists.
If we add a reasonable clause to this, changing it to “Atheism is lack of a belief in God or gods, in an agent that is capable of such a belief.” we end up with a psychological property. Psychological properties are uninteresting for philosophical discussion. “I lack a belief in God.” Well, we do believe in God. So what? Do you hold that lack of belief to be rationally justified?
They claim this lack of belief doesn’t have any additional impact on other beliefs.

Tired of Atheist stupidity and shallowness? Us too.
My name is Dean Esmay, and I am a secular social critic. I am also a former Atheist, and what I call a “Little-o” orthodox Christian. Orthodox Christianity is very different from the Bible-only, “believe or burn” type of Christianity so often stereotyped in the media and that are so often the loudmouths of the Internet, flinging Bible verses at people and giving you their own opinions, telling people that they’ll burn if they don’t believe in Jesus, etc.
Orthodox type Christians are not like that and don’t behave that way. We don’t knock on your doors either. We don’t believe in treating people of different races badly. We don’t believe in mistreating people, or treating them as less valuable than anyone else—even if they do things we think are bad for them, like sex outside of marriage and stuff like that. We don’t tell them how to live or think to judge them. We try to accept people for who they are, while telling them what we think is a Godly life. You aren’t required to believe us.
Orthodox type Christians include Eastern Orthodox, Assyrian/Non-Chalcedonian Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Coptics, and even Anglicans and others who still embrace historic orthodoxy.
I’ve started Escaping Atheism as a new project with some of my fellow little-o Orthodox Christians. Our goal isn’t to get you to believe or burn. Our goal isn’t even to get you to become a Christian, although obviously we’d be happy if you did. On the other hand, if you told us you accepted Jesus Christ as your personal savior right here and now, we would tell you that doesn’t mean anything, that the Demons in Hell know Jesus is Lord. You’ve got way more work to do than just saying the magic words and believing.
